# 1.5.0-032

- Stopped one unreadable source dataset from killing the whole run in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` ("Access Denied" on the
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES union). `source_project_filters` resolves source datasets
  from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA, but appearing in SCHEMATA does not mean the job
  account can read that dataset's INFORMATION_SCHEMA; because every metadata scan is
  one large UNION ALL over those datasets, a single unreadable one fails the entire
  statement, and the only remedy was to name it by hand in
  `source_project_filters[].dataset_exclude_patterns`. STEP 1 now runs an access
  pre-check right after `source_datasets` is resolved, gated by the new
  `skip_inaccessible_source_datasets BOOL DEFAULT TRUE` in [B]: each resolved dataset is
  probed once, unreadable ones are deleted from `source_datasets`, and the skipped list
  is emitted as a SKIPPED_INACCESSIBLE_SOURCE_DATASETS result so a narrowed scan is
  never silent. Because every union (TABLES / TABLE_OPTIONS in STEP 1, COLUMNS /
  COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS / TABLES in STEP 3) derives from `source_datasets`, pruning once
  protects all of them; the probe reads all four views in a single job
  (`(SELECT 1 FROM ... LIMIT 1) UNION ALL ...`) so a dataset with partial access is
  dropped here instead of surviving STEP 1 and killing STEP 3's COLUMNS scan. One
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA job per source dataset per run, no bytes billed; set the toggle
  FALSE for the previous all-or-nothing behavior. An ASSERT still fails the run if every
  dataset turns out unreadable. Skipping a dataset is not silently lossy in the analysis:
  its tables are absent from the metadata, so a referencing object resolves as "source no
  longer present" (WARNING, still publishable) rather than FAILED. SQL-only; the engine
  bundle is unchanged. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Added `analysis_include_generation_types` to `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`, a
  definition-source whitelist so a run can analyze one kind of definition -- most
  usefully `['DAG']` for DAG job SQL only. Until now the analysis scope had two axes
  (`analysis_include/exclude_dataset_patterns`, `analysis_include/exclude_object_patterns`)
  plus the `process_generated_tables` toggle, which can exclude generated tables but not
  select among them; the registry already records `generation_type`
  (`VIEW_DEFINITION` / `SCHEDULED_QUERY` / `DAG`, from STEP 2's `execution_source`
  classification) but nothing filtered on it, so "DAG only" was reachable only by
  pointing `scheduled_query_service_accounts` at a dummy account. The new
  `ARRAY<STRING>` in [A] defaults to `[]`, which keeps every kind and is byte-for-byte
  the previous behavior. [C] normalizes it once (trim / uppercase) into
  `analysis_generation_types` and ASSERTs every entry is one of the three known values,
  so a typo fails the run instead of silently reducing it to zero analysis targets.
  Like the other two axes the gate is applied at collection, keeping "registry ==
  analysis targets": STEP 1 drops all of `current_view_definitions` when
  VIEW_DEFINITION is not selected (the same path as excluding every View by name, so
  the "not found" rule deactivates stale rows rather than leaving them active), and
  STEP 2 gates `classified_jobs` on the same CASE that becomes `generation_type`
  (spelled out rather than referencing the `execution_source` alias, which is not
  visible to its own WHERE). This narrows what is analyzed, not what is scanned:
  STEP 1 still lists VIEWS and STEP 2 still scans JOBS -- `process_generated_tables`
  remains the way to skip the JOBS scan. SQL-only; the engine bundle is unchanged.
  Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Fixed a parenthesized set-operation branch that itself contains a set operation --
  `(SELECT id FROM aaa INTERSECT DISTINCT SELECT id FROM bbb) EXCEPT DISTINCT (SELECT id FROM ccc)`
  -- failing with "FromParser: JOIN was expected, but found \"INTERSECT\"" (engine).
  Not operator-specific: the same shape with `UNION ALL` failed identically, while
  `(A) UNION ALL (B)` (single-SELECT branches) worked. Two coupled defects. (1)
  `disableSetOperations` means "this token run is one branch of the set operation being
  split", guarding against re-splitting at the same depth, but
  `#stripWrappingParentheses` passed it straight into the parentheses. Parentheses open a
  fresh GoogleSQL `query_expr`, where a set operation is legal again, so the inner
  INTERSECT/UNION was never split and the operator stayed inside the FROM clause, where
  FromParser expected a JOIN. All three unwrapping paths (whole-query, `CREATE ... AS
  (...)`, and the CTE-body path added above) now pass `disableSetOperations: false`.
  (2) The split then assigned `firstQuery.set_operations = []` and
  `firstQuery.common_table_expressions = cteResult.ctes` unconditionally; once (1) was
  fixed, branch 0 can carry its own set operations and CTEs, and those assignments erased
  them along with every nested branch's lineage. Branch 0's `set_operations` are now kept
  and this level's CTEs are prepended (outer first). Flattening the nesting is sound for
  lineage: a set operation's output draws on every branch regardless of grouping. All
  branches (aaa, bbb, ccc) now resolve, in the analysis pass and in 03's throwing
  source-discovery pass alike. `SELECT * EXCEPT(col)` is still not a set operation
  (the modifier guard is unchanged). Test: test_v1_5_0_074. Bundle rebuilt
  (sha256 d7992396..., 465176 bytes); test:release 54 / golden 48 PASS.

- Fixed `WITH cte AS (...) (SELECT ...)` -- a CTE list followed by a *parenthesized*
  main query -- throwing "QueryParser: トップレベルのSELECT Clauseが見つかりません"
  (engine). GoogleSQL's `query_expr` is `[WITH ...] { select | ( query_expr ) | set_op }`,
  so the parentheses after the CTE list are valid syntax, but ClauseParser only looks for
  a depth-0 SELECT and the SELECT sits at depth 1 here. Neither existing unwrapper
  applied: `#stripWrappingParentheses` requires the *query* to start with `(`, and
  `#stripStatementBodyParentheses` only fires right after a depth-0 `AS`. QueryParser now
  checks, after CTE parsing, whether the main-query tokens (from `main_start_index`) are
  wholly wrapped in parentheses; if so it re-parses the inner query and prepends this
  level's CTEs (outer CTEs first, so an inner `WITH` can still reference them). A
  parenthesized body that is itself a set operation or carries its own `WITH` resolves
  too; `WITH ... (SELECT ...) UNION ALL (SELECT ...)` still takes the set-operation path
  because the closing parenthesis is not the last token. Known limitation (unchanged):
  trailing clauses after the parenthesized body (`WITH a AS (...) (SELECT ...) ORDER BY 1`)
  are still unsupported, as they are for the non-CTE form. Test: test_v1_5_0_073. Bundle
  rebuilt (sha256 f448d53..., 463531 bytes); test:release 53 / golden 48 PASS.

- Fixed untyped STRUCT field aliases `STRUCT(expr AS name, ...)` throwing
  "ExpressionParser: expected \")\", but found \"AS\"" in non-recoverable positions
  (engine). The function-call argument loop never consumed a struct field's
  `AS <name>`, so `STRUCT(a AS x)` only parsed inside a SELECT list (where per-item
  recovery hides it) and failed anywhere a parse error is structural -- FROM's
  `UNNEST(...)`, WHERE, etc. DAG SQL such as
  `CROSS JOIN UNNEST(IF(ARRAY_LENGTH(x) > 0, x, [STRUCT(CAST(NULL AS STRING) AS id, CAST(NULL AS TIMESTAMP) AS start_dtime)]))`
  failed in 03's source-discovery pass (which runs with strict/throw defaults, not
  the analysis pass's non-strict recovery). Now, for STRUCT calls only, an optional
  `AS <name>` after each argument is consumed and discarded (a field label carries no
  lineage; the value expression's lineage is unchanged). Scoped to STRUCT so other
  functions still surface real syntax errors. Test: test_v1_5_0_072.

- Made ExpressionParser syntax errors locatable: `#expect` now appends
  `at line L column C (token_seq N) near: <surrounding tokens>` to its message, so a
  parse failure recorded by 03 as a diagnostic can be pinpointed in the (often huge,
  single-line) generated SQL without source offsets. Diagnostic text only; parsing is
  unchanged. Test: test_v1_5_0_071. Bundle rebuilt (sha256 ad18b4b..., 461888 bytes);
  test:release 52 / golden 48 PASS.

- Allowed a parenthesized FROM subquery to begin with `WITH` or a set operation,
  not only `SELECT` (engine). `FromParser.#parseSubquerySource` required the first
  inner token to be `SELECT` and threw "parenthesized FROM source must begin with
  SELECT", even though it delegates parsing to `QueryParser`, which already handles
  CTEs and UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT. DAG-generated SQL of the form
  `FROM (WITH xxx AS (...) SELECT ... INTERSECT DISTINCT (WITH zzz AS (...) SELECT ...))`
  failed to parse. Relaxed the guard to accept `SELECT`, `WITH`, or `(` (a
  parenthesized set-operation branch) as the query start; both branches now resolve
  to their physical columns with no diagnostics. Test: test_v1_5_0_070. Bundle
  rebuilt (sha256 c4c5863..., 460181 bytes); test:release 48 / golden 48 PASS.

- Fixed a UNION ALL column-count mismatch when building `current_target_columns` /
  `current_target_column_field_paths` in 03 STEP 3 ("Queries in UNION ALL have
  mismatched column count. Query 1 has 22 columns, Query 10 has 29 columns"). Each
  per-dataset branch used `SELECT * FROM <dataset>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
  (and COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS), but those views expose a varying number of trailing
  columns across datasets/projects (collation, rounding_mode, policy tags, ...), so
  the branches had different shapes and the UNION failed. Replaced `SELECT *` with an
  explicit projection of the stable columns the resolver actually consumes
  (COLUMNS: table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, column_name, ordinal_position,
  data_type, is_nullable; COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS: table_catalog, table_schema,
  table_name, column_name, field_path, data_type), in both the union branches and
  the empty-table COALESCE fallbacks. SQL-only.

- Fixed `{project_token}` not being substituted in the UDF library URI
  (`bootstrap_udf_library_uri` in 01 and 04): the URI was missing from the runtime
  REPLACE list, so a `{project_token}` placeholder in it reached the CREATE FUNCTION
  / validation as a literal and failed. Added the URI to the REPLACE block in both
  scripts.

- Added early guards (task A) so an unsubstituted `{project_token}` (or any invalid
  character) surfaces at setup time instead of as a confusing failure at DDL/query
  time. After the REPLACE block, each script now ASSERTs that its dataset-name
  inputs (repository / udf / target / audit, as applicable, plus each
  bootstrap_target_datasets entry) match `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$` -- which also catches a
  leftover `{project_token}` since braces are invalid -- and 01/04 additionally
  ASSERT the GCS library URI no longer contains `{project_token}` (a URI is not an
  identifier, so it is checked for the placeholder only). Prefix/suffix inputs were
  already covered by the assembled table/UDF-name ASSERTs. SQL-only.

- 01 setup summary (step 7) now also reports `project_id` (the auto-detected
  project) and `project_token` (the substring extracted by
  `bootstrap_project_token_pattern`) as its first two columns, so a run can be
  verified at a glance: the `{project_token}` placeholder in dataset / prefix /
  suffix inputs is substituted at runtime (in [C], before names are assembled), so
  the summary's `repository_dataset` etc. show the resolved names, and the new
  columns show the token that produced them. Display-only.

- Aligned the `[A]` group order across all scripts to match 03: project-token
  substitution first, then datasets, then table naming, then UDF naming, then the
  file-specific groups. For consistency with the "[A] = set per deployment"
  principle, moved `project_token_pattern` and `udf_name_prefix` / `udf_name_suffix`
  from `[B]` into `[A]` in 04/06/07 (they were already in `[A]` in 01; 08/09 have no
  UDF naming). Each variable is still declared exactly once and before the first
  statement; the `[C]` assembly/REPLACE references are unchanged. Comment/order only;
  behavior unchanged. SQL-only.

- Consolidated 03's target-side object filters from three overlapping groups into
  two, on the principle that the registry holds exactly the analysis targets (no
  "collect but do not analyze" stage). Removed `target_dataset_include/exclude_
  patterns` and `registry_exclude_object/dataset_patterns`; kept the `analysis_*`
  set with widened meaning: `analysis_include/exclude_dataset_patterns` is now the
  dataset scope (resolves which target datasets are scanned for Views AND bounds the
  generated-table jobs), and `analysis_include/exclude_object_patterns` is the
  object-name filter applied at collection (STEP 1 for Views, STEP 2 for generated
  TABLEs). Both filters now run at collection, so only matching objects enter the
  registry and are analyzed; excluded objects are neither registered nor change-
  tracked (an object newly excluded by a config change is deactivated by orphan
  cleanup). The analysis-time re-application (changed_datasets probe and per-dataset
  materialization) was dropped -- the probe keeps only the `process_generated_tables`
  toggle, and the per-dataset loop scopes via `LOWER(object_dataset) =
  LOWER(@current_dataset)`. `source_project_filters` is unchanged (it is a separate
  axis: the schema-read scope of the referenced physical/base tables, the widest
  scope). 09's report scope was renamed `target_dataset_*` -> `analysis_*_dataset`
  to match 03. Consequence: the STEP 5 / 09 "REGISTERED_NOT_YET_ANALYZED" category
  is effectively gone (only a momentary timing gap). Also moved the `udf_name_prefix`
  / `udf_name_suffix` DECLAREs from `[B]` to `[A]` (deployment naming knobs, like the
  table prefix/suffix), and reordered `[A]` to: project-token, datasets, table
  naming, UDF naming, source scope, analysis dataset scope, analysis object filter,
  service accounts. SQL-only; the engine bundle is unchanged. Not yet validated
  against BigQuery.

- Reorganized each script's `[A]` (required per-deployment) config section into a
  consistent "grouped DECLAREs + variable notes" layout (01/03/04/06/07/08/09).
  Previously `[A]` interleaved a multi-line description comment before each DECLARE;
  now the DECLAREs sit in one contiguous block, split into purpose groups each
  introduced by a single one-line header comment (e.g. `-- Datasets (repository /
  UDF)`, `-- Table naming (prefix / suffix)`), so the settable variables are
  visible at a glance. There are no per-line inline comments; the full descriptions
  follow the block under a `Variable notes:` header keyed by variable name.
  Comment/whitespace reorganization only -- every variable is still declared
  exactly once, all DECLAREs still precede the first statement, and no defaults
  changed, so behavior is unchanged. SQL-only; the engine bundle is unchanged.
  Follow-up: moved the `default_project_id` (01/04: `bootstrap_default_project_id`)
  DECLARE out of `[A]` and into `[B]`, since it is auto-detected at runtime (in
  `[C]`) rather than set per deployment; `[A]` keeps only a one-line pointer comment
  to it, and its full description moved to `[B]` alongside the DECLARE. Still
  declared once and before the first statement, so behavior is unchanged.

- Added a project-token substitution so a piece of the (auto-detected) project id
  can be embedded in object names. Each script (01/03/04/06/07/08/09) declares a
  configurable `project_token_pattern` regex; right after the project is
  auto-detected, `project_token = COALESCE(REGEXP_EXTRACT(<project_id>, pattern),
  '')` (capture group 1 if present) is computed and every literal `{project_token}`
  placeholder in the name inputs -- dataset names, and the table / view / UDF
  prefixes & suffixes -- is `REPLACE`d with it, before the names are assembled and
  asserted. E.g. project id `mycompany-prod-123` with `r'-([^-]+)-'` yields `prod`,
  so `table_name_prefix = '{project_token}_'` becomes `prod_`. The default pattern
  takes the first hyphen-delimited segment. Because `{project_token}` uses braces
  (not valid in identifiers), any placeholder left unreplaced (empty token or a
  config typo) is caught by the existing name ASSERTs. Keep each script's pattern
  in step with 01. SQL-only; the engine bundle is unchanged. Not yet validated
  against BigQuery.

- Made UDF (routine) names prefix/suffix-configurable, mirroring the tables. New
  dedicated `*_udf_name_prefix` / `*_udf_name_suffix` variables (default '') in 01
  (creates), 03 (daily), and 04/06/07 (which call the analysis UDF) assemble the
  UDF names as `udf_prefix + 'lnge_' + base + udf_suffix`
  (`analyze_json` / `fingerprint_sql` / `render_dynamic_sql`). Kept separate from
  the table prefix/suffix because routine names allow only letters/digits/'_' (no
  '-', unlike backtick-quoted tables); a hyphen is caught by the existing
  `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$` name ASSERT. The prefix/suffix must be kept in step between 01
  and the callers so the pipeline finds the functions.

- Auto-detect the GCP project instead of hardcoding the `project_id` placeholder.
  In every script (01/03/04/06/07/08/09) `default_project_id` (01/04:
  `bootstrap_default_project_id`) is now resolved at runtime from
  ``EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FORMAT("SELECT DISTINCT catalog_name FROM `region-%s`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA LIMIT 1", @@location) INTO ...`` (catalog_name = the
  project the job runs in), with an ASSERT that it resolved. The role-specific
  `*_project_id` variables changed from `DEFAULT default_project_id` to
  `DEFAULT NULL` and are set via `COALESCE(role, default_project_id)` in a SET
  block right after the DECLAREs, preserving the "pin one role by setting a
  literal" behavior (a literal wins over the auto-detected default). To pin the
  whole project, replace the auto-detect SET with a literal. 04 also moved its
  `repository_dataset_full_name` assembly into that SET block (it previously
  DECLARE-DEFAULTed from the project, which is NULL until auto-detect runs). The
  debug script is intentionally left with the manual placeholder. SQL-only; the
  engine bundle is unchanged. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Applied a system-identity `lnge_` prefix to every table, view, and UDF this
  system creates/uses, and removed the now-redundant inline "lineage" from the
  canonical base names. Names assemble as `<prefix> + 'lnge_' + marker + base +
  <suffix>` (marker `m_`/`t_` for tables, `vw_` + `t_`/`m_` for views). Mapping:
  `m_lineage_definition_registry`→`lnge_m_definition_registry`,
  `m_lineage_job_registry`→`lnge_m_job_registry`,
  `t_lineage_direct_dependency`→`lnge_t_direct_dependency`,
  `t_lineage_impact`→`lnge_t_impact`, `t_lineage_diagnostic`→`lnge_t_diagnostic`,
  `t_lineage_column_usage`→`lnge_t_column_usage`,
  `t_lineage_unanalyzed_definition`→`lnge_t_unanalyzed_definition`,
  `vw_t_lineage_column_usage_impact`→`lnge_vw_t_column_usage_impact`; UDFs
  `analyze_lineage_json`→`lnge_analyze_json`,
  `fingerprint_lineage_sql`→`lnge_fingerprint_sql`,
  `render_dynamic_sql`→`lnge_render_dynamic_sql`. Applied across 01/03/04/06/07/08/09
  and the bigquery/ + debug/ scripts; the `04` validation `required_tables` list and
  the `04`/`06`/debug backtick table references (which used stale no-marker names)
  were corrected to the new names too. The dataset `lineage_repository`, the GCS
  bundle `lineage_udf_bundle.js`, file names, and the JS API names
  (`analyzeLineageForBigQuery` etc.) are intentionally unchanged. UDF renames only
  change the SQL function name (the JS library binding is unaffected), so the
  engine bundle is unchanged. Existing deployments need a rename migration (create
  the new objects, or `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`, and recreate the UDFs/view). Not
  yet validated against BigQuery.

- Closed a timing window that made an object transiently FAIL when a source table
  it references is dropped mid-run. The publishability classifier
  (`batch_object_source_flags`) judged source existence against
  `current_target_tables`, a snapshot taken in STEP 1, while column metadata is
  collected in STEP 3. A table dropped between the two scans still appeared in the
  STEP 1 snapshot, so it looked "present but with no columns" (a coverage gap ->
  object non-publishable -> FAILED, and its absent-source "metadata not found"
  WARNING was written to lineage_diagnostic), even though the table no longer
  existed; the next run self-healed once it was gone from the snapshot too. STEP 3
  now builds `current_referenced_tables`, a fresh `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` scan
  taken alongside the column metadata and over the same referenced source
  datasets, and the classifier's existence check reads it instead of the STEP 1
  snapshot. A table that no longer exists when its columns are scanned is now
  correctly treated as absent (publishable, warning suppressed); genuine coverage
  gaps (table present at scan time, columns empty) are still flagged. Existence and
  columns are now read at effectively the same moment, shrinking the window to the
  seconds between the STEP 3 TABLES and COLUMNS scans. SQL-only; the engine bundle
  is unchanged. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Added a `generation_type` column to the diagnostic table (`t_lineage_diagnostic`)
  so a reader can tell whether a diagnostic's SQL is a View definition or a
  generated-table job SQL, without joining the registry. `object_type` only says
  VIEW vs TABLE; `generation_type` is 'VIEW_DEFINITION' for a View (its SQL is
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS.view_definition) or the job execution source
  ('SCHEDULED_QUERY' / 'DAG' / ...) for a generated table (its SQL is the
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS query). The value was already carried through the
  pipeline's diagnostic staging (used as a join key) and is simply now persisted.
  01 setup adds the (nullable) column; 03 STEP 3 writes it in all three diagnostic
  sources (UDF diagnostics, the non-publishable marker, and pre-analysis failures);
  06's single-object maintenance path writes it too. Nullable so no diagnostic
  write path can fail on it. SQL-only; the engine bundle is unchanged. Not yet
  validated against BigQuery.

- Added the `vw_t_lineage_column_usage_impact` view (created by 01 setup, right after
  the `t_lineage_column_usage` / `t_lineage_impact` tables it reads) that joins the
  column usage index to the impact graph, so a Looker report can pick an ORIGIN
  column and see every downstream usage site with a DEPTH like impact_rank, plus
  the value-flow path. Depth is relative to a chosen origin (the same usage site
  sits at different depths for different origins), so it is computed per (origin,
  usage-site) on read rather than stored as an ambiguous single rank on the usage
  table. The view is the UNION of: direct references of the origin column
  (depth = 1) from `t_lineage_column_usage`; and, joining `t_lineage_impact`
  (impacted column = usage source column), references of columns the origin impacts
  (depth = impact_rank + 1), carrying `dependency_path` for the route. Each row
  also exposes `usage_definition_hash` -- the `definition_hash` of the object that
  contains the reference -- as a join key to pull that object's actual SQL (e.g.
  from `m_lineage_definition_registry`) when the metadata and line number are not
  enough to understand a usage. Impact is
  fully replaced each STEP 4 run, so the view always reflects the current snapshot
  with no snapshot filter. To (re)create just the view on an existing deployment
  (or after a table-name change), run 01's `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` block on its
  own -- it holds no data, so it is safe to replace anytime. SQL-only; the engine
  bundle is unchanged. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Added a per-reference column usage index (`t_lineage_column_usage`) for
  requirement-change impact review: "select a table/view + column → where and how
  is it used". Unlike the impact table (value-flow / SELECT lineage), this captures
  references in ALL clauses (SELECT / WHERE / JOIN_ON / JOIN_UNNEST / FROM_UNNEST /
  GROUP_BY / HAVING / QUALIFY / ORDER_BY), one row per resolved physical-column
  reference, with `usage_type` (the clause), `reference_name`, the resolved source
  physical column (`source_project/dataset/object/object_type/column/field_path`,
  VIEW/TABLE classified as for the dependency edges), the referencing object, and
  `line_number` / `column_number` / `line_text` (the single source line holding the
  reference token). Engine: the exporter now emits a flattened `column_usages`
  table, built from `physical_column_references` (which already carry `clause_type`
  + resolved physical columns) with line info derived from the token's `line_no`
  and the original SQL; derived / unresolved references are excluded. Bundle
  rebuilt (`sha256 37aec3cd…`, 459728 bytes). SQL: 01 creates the table; 03 STEP 3
  stages `batch_staged_column_usage` from the UDF `column_usages` for COMPLETED
  objects and publishes it with the same delete-by-object + insert, backup /
  rollback, and deactivated-object orphan-cleanup machinery as the direct
  dependencies. The table is not one of render_dynamic_sql's fixed `__T_*__`
  placeholders, so it is addressed by a directly-built qualified name
  (`column_usage_fqn`); 03 also `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` it once for
  deployments whose 01 predates it (authoritative schema stays in 01). The
  companion ask — trace a downstream SELECTed column back to its origin and the
  path it takes — is already answered by the existing impact table
  (`origin`/`impacted` + `dependency_path`), so no new work there. Test:
  `test_v1_5_0_069`. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Persisted the 09 report as a repository table refreshed at the end of the daily
  pipeline. `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` gains STEP 5, which runs
  unconditionally after STEP 4 and does one `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  <prefix>t_lineage_unanalyzed_definition<suffix>` — the currently-existing
  (is_active, non-ephemeral) definition-registry objects that are NOT fully
  covered by analysis (NOT `COMPLETED` / `COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS` with
  `last_analyzed_hash` = `definition_hash`), each tagged with a `coverage_reason`
  (`REGISTERED_NOT_YET_ANALYZED` / `ANALYSIS_<status>` /
  `DEFINITION_CHANGED_NOT_REANALYZED`) and deduped by `definition_hash`, plus a
  `refreshed_at`. It is built straight from the registry (whose `definition_text` /
  `definition_hash` / `analysis_status` are already synchronized by STEP 1-2), so
  it adds no INFORMATION_SCHEMA re-scan and never piles up across runs (full
  refresh). The table's qualified name is assembled directly (backtick-quoted; it
  is not one of render_dynamic_sql's fixed `__T_*__` placeholders), a new
  `table_unanalyzed_definition` name variable is declared in [C] alongside the
  other repository table names, and the table is created by the STEP 5 statement
  itself (no 01 dependency; CLUSTER BY / OPTIONS keep it self-describing).
  Difference vs the on-demand 09: registry-excluded objects (`NOT_REGISTERED`) are
  not in the registry and so are absent from this table; 09 still surfaces them by
  re-scanning INFORMATION_SCHEMA. SQL-only; the engine bundle is unchanged. Not yet
  validated against BigQuery.

- Parsed a FROM-position table-valued function call (e.g. `EXTERNAL_QUERY`) as an
  opaque source instead of failing. A job SQL of the form
  `FROM EXTERNAL_QUERY('conn', '''SELECT ...''') AS a` produced "Source discovery
  did not complete" / FromParser "JOIN was expected but found `(`": the FROM
  source grammar only knew ordinary tables, UNNEST, and subqueries, so it read
  `EXTERNAL_QUERY` as a table name and then hit the `(` in the JOIN loop. The
  parser now recognizes a name (optionally dotted, `dataset.my_tvf(...)`) directly
  followed by `(` as a table-function call: it skips the balanced parentheses
  without analyzing their contents, takes an optional alias (the `AS a` may be
  absent), and emits a new `TABLE_FUNCTION` source. Federated / TVF output is not a
  BigQuery physical table and its columns have no physical lineage, so the resolver
  treats a `TABLE_FUNCTION` column as a resolved external terminal
  (`EXTERNAL_SOURCE_RESOLVED`): a qualified `a.col`, a single-source unqualified
  reference, and — as a last resort only, so a real table in the same join always
  wins and no false AMBIGUOUS arises — an unqualified reference with no other
  match, all resolve to it with no lineage edge and no diagnostic (unlike
  `DERIVED_SOURCE_RESOLVED`, which would flag it PARTIALLY_RESOLVED for having no
  traceable upstream). A real table joined with `EXTERNAL_QUERY` still produces its
  own lineage normally. Engine change: rebuilt the bundle
  (`sha256 ff87a852…`, 455709 bytes). Test: `test_v1_5_0_068`. Not yet validated
  against BigQuery.

- Added `sql/maintenance/09_unanalyzed_object_definitions.sql`, a read-only,
  on-demand report that lists the SQL of objects that CURRENTLY EXIST but are not
  covered by lineage analysis, so an operator can see what is missing from the
  graph and why. It surfaces two kinds of objects: (1) Views, from
  `target_project.dataset.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS` (view_definition), unioned
  across every target dataset; and (2) generated TABLEs from
  `region-<job_region>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT` whose destination table
  STILL EXISTS now (confirmed against region `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, so a job
  whose destination has since been dropped — a definition that no longer exists —
  is excluded, per the request). Coverage is decided from the definition registry:
  an object is covered when a registry row is COMPLETED / COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS
  AND its `last_analyzed_hash` equals the object's current definition hash;
  everything else is reported and tagged `coverage_reason` (`NOT_REGISTERED`,
  `REGISTERED_NOT_YET_ANALYZED`, `ANALYSIS_<status>`, or
  `DEFINITION_CHANGED_NOT_REANALYZED`). Results are DISTINCT by definition
  (deduped on `definition_hash = TO_HEX(SHA256(sql))` via `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER()`),
  so repeated Scheduled Query / DAG runs of the same SQL collapse to one row and
  the report does not pile up across runs. For CTAS jobs the `CREATE ... AS` prefix
  is stripped with the exact regex from 03's `normalized_definitions`, so the
  computed hash lines up with the registry's stored hash. Mirrors the 08 report
  skeleton and the 03 [A]/[B]/[C] DECLARE layout; all qualified identifiers are
  backtick-quoted (team rule) and anonymized (`project_id` / `dataset`). SQL-only;
  the engine bundle is unchanged. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Hardened the STEP 2 children filter so a parent `SCRIPT` job is never analyzed.
  The script-variable work widened the JOBS scan to also read `SCRIPT` jobs (for
  DECLARE extraction), and excluded them from the generated-table flow with
  `destination_table IS NOT NULL`. But some `SCRIPT` jobs DO carry a
  `destination_table` (e.g. a script whose single effective statement is a CTAS),
  so such a script slipped into the flow, was registered as a generated table, and
  was handed to the analysis UDF as a whole multi-statement script — producing a
  query-parser "top-level SELECT not found" failure. The `target_jobs` filter now
  also requires `statement_type IN UNNEST(collected_statement_types)` (a `SCRIPT`
  is never a collected type), so scripts are used only for variable extraction and
  never registered or analyzed. Self-healing: the child SELECT / CTAS statement was
  always collected, so once the script is excluded the child becomes the
  representative for its destination and the next run overwrites the registry row's
  `definition_text` with the single statement (re-analyzed cleanly); ephemeral
  variants age out by fingerprint recency. SQL-only; the engine bundle is
  unchanged. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Wired the pipeline half of script-variable handling (case X: persist on the
  registry). `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` adds a nullable
  `script_variables ARRAY<STRING>` column to the definition registry (with an
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` migration note for existing
  deployments, since the CREATE is destructive). `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`
  STEP 2 now, in the SAME `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT` scan, also reads
  parent `SCRIPT` jobs (they have no destination table, so the scan's WHERE was
  widened; children still require a destination) and captures `parent_job_id`. From
  those it builds `script_declared_variables` (DECLAREd names per SCRIPT, extracted
  with `REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(query, r'(?i)\bDECLARE\s+(<ident-list>)')` and split on
  commas, restricted to scripts that are actually a `parent_job_id` of a collected
  child) and `job_script_variables` (child job → its parent's variable names). The
  names ride into `latest_generated_table_definitions` via a `job_id` join and are
  MERGEd into the registry's new column (UPDATE uses
  `COALESCE(source, target)` so an older representative not re-collected this run
  never erases a stored value). STEP 3 threads `script_variables` from the registry
  through the discovery accumulator (`changed_definitions_to_analyze` →
  `all_changed_with_discovery` → per-dataset read → `batch_analysis_input`) and adds
  it to the per-object analysis-UDF options STRUCT, so the engine (previous entry)
  treats a script variable as an opaque value rather than a missing column. Only
  child statements of a script carry values; Views and non-script jobs stay NULL
  (engine no-op). SQL-only; the engine bundle is unchanged. Not yet validated
  against BigQuery.

- Added a `script_variables` analysis option so a BigQuery multi-statement script's
  child statement no longer false-fails on the parent's variables. A script like
  `DECLARE aaa STRING; SET aaa='20250818'; SELECT * FROM t WHERE dt = aaa` records
  the parent as statement_type=SCRIPT and the child `SELECT ... WHERE dt = aaa` as
  its own statement_type=SELECT job — and the child's stored query text has no
  DECLARE/SET context, so `aaa` appears as a bare identifier indistinguishable from
  a column and resolved to PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND (ERROR → FAILED, retried).
  Unlike `@param` / `?`, a script variable has no syntactic marker, so the fix uses
  context: `analyzeLineageForBigQuery`'s options now accept
  `script_variables: [...]` (the parent script's declared variable names). In the
  physical resolver, an unqualified reference that could not be resolved as a column
  (PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND / UNRESOLVED_COLUMN) whose name is in that set is
  reclassified as `SCRIPT_VARIABLE_RESOLVED` — an opaque value with no lineage and
  no diagnostic. Column precedence is preserved: a name that DOES resolve to a real
  column stays a column (BigQuery resolves a column over a same-named variable), and
  an ambiguous-but-real column stays ambiguous; a qualified `t.aaa` is never treated
  as a variable; and a not-found name that is not in the set still errors (no
  over-suppression). Empty/absent `script_variables` changes nothing. This is the
  engine half; the pipeline half (03 STEP 2 collecting the parent SCRIPT's DECLAREs
  by `parent_job_id` and passing them per object) follows separately. Test:
  `test_v1_5_0_067.js`. Engine change: bundle rebuilt (`release_manifest.json`
  sha256 / size_bytes updated); redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Recognized positional query parameters (`?`) so parameterized DAG SQL analyzes
  cleanly. Parameterized queries (run by DAGs / clients) keep their `@name` and
  `?` placeholders in the stored SQL text (JOBS.query); the parameter *values* are
  bound separately, so the analyzer sees the placeholders. Named `@param` was
  already lexed as a PARAMETER token and worked, but a bare positional `?` — a
  parameter with no identifier — was an unknown character that failed the parse
  (PARTIAL_FAILURE), which is indistinguishable from a genuinely unresolvable
  object. Fix: the lexer now reads `?` as a PARAMETER token, exactly like `@name`.
  A parameter is an opaque value with no lineage, so `?` anywhere (WHERE, IN list,
  LIMIT, SELECT, BETWEEN) no longer affects lineage and the analysis COMPLETEs;
  named `@param` behavior is unchanged. Test: `test_v1_5_0_066.js`. Engine change:
  bundle rebuilt (`release_manifest.json` sha256 / size_bytes updated); redeploy
  the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Allowed `-` (hyphen) in the repository table names this system creates. The
  name-format ASSERTs on `table_definition_registry` / `table_direct_dependency` /
  `table_impact` / `table_diagnostic` / `table_job_registry` (in
  `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` and `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`) went
  from `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$` to `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`, so a `table_name_prefix` /
  `table_name_suffix` containing a hyphen (e.g. `-tky`) is accepted. This is safe
  because every reference to these tables is backtick-quoted (01 CREATE, 03/06/07/08
  reads, all via `` `project.dataset.table` ``), matching the team's
  backtick-mandatory rule; BigQuery permits `-` in a table name when it is always
  quoted. Dataset names, UDF/routine names, target view names, and resolved target
  dataset names are unchanged — they keep `^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$` because BigQuery does
  not allow `-` in datasets or routine identifiers. Note: hyphenated ("flexible")
  table names must always be backtick-quoted and are not supported by every BI tool
  (e.g. some Looker Studio paths) — prefer `_` unless a hyphen is required. SQL-only;
  the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Fixed a false `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_AMBIGUOUS` for an `UNNEST` array argument whose
  column name collides with a column exposed by a source joined *after* the
  `UNNEST`. Symptom: with a CTE that has a column `col`,
  `SELECT Col FROM d.t AS t, UNNEST(Col) AS Col INNER JOIN cte AS t2 ON Col =
  t2.col` reported `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_AMBIGUOUS` for `Col` with candidate sources
  `[D.T, CTE]` (COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS), even though the argument of `UNNEST(Col)`
  can only be the array column `Col` of the preceding `t`. Cause: the unqualified
  candidate search considered every source in the scope, so the later-joined CTE
  (whose `col` matches case-insensitively) was offered as a rival candidate.
  In GoogleSQL an `UNNEST` array argument is lateral — it can reference only
  range variables introduced earlier (to its left) in the same `FROM`, plus outer
  scopes; sources joined after it are not yet in scope. Fix: `#findUnqualifiedCandidates`
  now takes the owning `UNNEST` source and, in that source's own scope, drops the
  owner itself and every source that appears after it (`source_seq` greater),
  leaving only preceding sources (outer scopes are unrestricted for correlation).
  No over-suppression: an argument that is genuinely ambiguous across two
  *preceding* sources is still `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_AMBIGUOUS`, and ordinary
  (non-`UNNEST`) column ambiguity is unchanged. Extends the earlier "an `UNNEST`
  argument cannot reference its own element" fix to also exclude later siblings.
  Test: `test_v1_5_0_065.js`. Engine change: bundle rebuilt
  (`release_manifest.json` sha256 / size_bytes updated); redeploy the UDF bundle
  to GCS.

- Fixed absent-source not-found WARNINGS leaking into `lineage_diagnostic` for
  JOBS-sourced objects after the option-D metadata scoping. STEP 3 suppresses the
  diagnostics of *publishable* objects (exact COMPLETED, or COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS
  whose warnings are all from sources absent from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES), so a
  reference to a gone table should finish clean. But option D scoped
  `current_target_columns` (the COLUMNS scan, used for `has_columns`) to only the
  referenced source datasets, while `current_target_tables` (the TABLES scan, used
  for `exists_in_tables`) still covers every source dataset because STEP 2 needs
  it. In `batch_object_source_flags` this scope mismatch made a source that exists
  in a dataset that was NOT column-scanned look `exists_in_tables = TRUE` AND
  `has_columns = FALSE` → `has_present_uncollected_source = TRUE` → object
  non-publishable → its absent-source not-found warnings were recorded. Fix:
  restrict the existence check in `batch_object_source_flags` to the same
  referenced datasets the columns were collected for, so a source whose dataset
  was not column-scanned is treated as absent (`has_absent_source`, suppressed)
  rather than present-but-uncollected. Genuine coverage gaps within a referenced
  dataset (table present, columns empty) are still flagged and still FAIL. Before
  option D both scans covered all datasets, so this class of object was already
  suppressed — this restores that for the scoped world. SQL-only (STEP 3 flag
  computation); the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Stopped an unqualified column reference to a no-longer-existing source table from
  hard-failing analysis of a JOBS-sourced object. A DAG / generated-table SQL often
  references temporary or short-lived tables that are gone by analysis time.
  Symptom: `SELECT col1 FROM ghost_ds.ghost_table AS a JOIN real_ds.real_t AS b ON
  a.id = b.id`, where `ghost_table` has no collected columns and `real_t` does not
  contain `col1`, produced `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` (ERROR) →
  COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS → non-publishable → registry FAILED and retried every run.
  A *qualified* reference to the same absent table (`a.col1`) was already only a
  `PHYSICAL_METADATA_NOT_FOUND` WARNING (via `#resolveAgainstPhysicalSource` /
  `#hasMetadataForSource`), so the prior absent-source publish handling (STEP 3
  `batch_object_source_flags`, which classifies a source absent from
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES as gone) covered qualified references but not
  unqualified ones. Cause: the multi-candidate path `#disambiguateAcrossSources`
  emitted `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` whenever no *present* (metadata-collected)
  source exposed the column, ignoring whether a candidate source had no collected
  metadata at all. Fix: when the column is found in no present source but a
  candidate physical source has no collected metadata (absent or uncollected), the
  reference is now classified as `PHYSICAL_METADATA_NOT_FOUND` (WARNING) and
  attributed to that source — the column may legitimately belong to the gone
  table, exactly as the qualified case already behaves. The absent-vs-uncollected
  distinction stays with STEP 3 (INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES): a genuinely gone
  source is published, a present-but-uncollected source (real coverage gap) still
  FAILs. No over-suppression: when every source is present with metadata, a missing
  column is still an ERROR (`PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`), and the `PHYSICAL_AMBIGUOUS`
  path (column in >1 present source) is unchanged. Test: `test_v1_5_0_064.js`.
  Engine change: bundle rebuilt (`release_manifest.json` sha256 / size_bytes
  updated); redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Moved the collection/analysis scope filters in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`
  from `[B] BEHAVIOR OPTIONS` to `[A] REQUIRED per deployment / region`:
  `registry_exclude_object_patterns` / `registry_exclude_dataset_patterns` and
  `analysis_include_object_patterns` / `analysis_exclude_object_patterns` /
  `analysis_include_dataset_patterns` / `analysis_exclude_dataset_patterns`. These
  determine which objects a given deployment registers and analyzes, so they belong
  with the must-review settings. Comment blocks moved with the variables; each is
  still declared exactly once and behavior is unchanged. SQL-only.

- Applied the same `[A] REQUIRED / [B] BEHAVIOR OPTIONS / [C] DERIVED-INTERNAL`
  three-section DECLARE layout to the remaining scripts: `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql`,
  `04_validate_lineage_environment.sql`, `06_analyze_changed_objects.sql`,
  `07_run_single_view_analysis.sql`, and `08_view_last_access.sql`. In each, the
  must-edit settings are grouped first ([A]: default project, repository/UDF
  datasets, region, the GCS bundle URI in 01/04, the audit sink in 08, table
  name prefix/suffix, the single target view in 07), tuning knobs follow ([B]:
  UDF names, parser/compact/max-impact options, lookback and dataset-filter
  patterns), and the auto-computed values are separated at the end and marked
  "DO NOT edit" ([C]: the role-specific *_project_id defaulting to the master,
  the @@location-mirroring region/location variables, FORMAT-derived names, and
  all working variables). Pure reordering of DECLAREs plus comments: every
  variable, type, and default is unchanged (verified each declared exactly once,
  the master project variable still precedes the role variables that default to
  it, and all DECLAREs remain ahead of the block's first statement). Behavior is
  identical. SQL-only; the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated against
  BigQuery.

- Reorganized the `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` DECLARE block into three
  labelled sections so operators can see at a glance what to edit per deployment /
  region. `[A] REQUIRED per deployment / region` (default_project_id, repository /
  UDF datasets, source_project_filters, target dataset patterns, STEP 2 service
  accounts, table name prefix/suffix) is grouped first; `[B] BEHAVIOR OPTIONS`
  (UDF names, parser_strict_mode, max impact rank, process_generated_tables,
  registry/analysis filters, lookback windows, statement types, label toggles)
  follows; `[C] DERIVED / INTERNAL` (job_region ← @@location, the role-specific
  *_project_id ← default_project_id, the runtime-resolved target_datasets, and all
  working variables) is separated at the end and marked "DO NOT edit". The header
  documents the split and points to `SET @@location` (top of file) plus section
  [A] as the only things to change when standing up a new region. Purely a
  reordering of DECLAREs plus comments: every variable, type, and default is
  unchanged (verified each declared exactly once, no duplicates), the master
  `default_project_id` still precedes the role variables that default to it, and
  all DECLAREs remain ahead of the first SET. Behavior is identical. SQL-only; the
  engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Made the GCP project a single point of configuration in every pipeline/maintenance
  script. Each script previously repeated `DEFAULT 'project_id'` for each role
  (repository / target / UDF, plus audit in 08), even though those roles always share
  one project in this deployment. Each script now declares one master
  `default_project_id` (`bootstrap_default_project_id` in the `bootstrap_`-prefixed
  01 / 04) and the role-specific `*_project_id` variables `DEFAULT` to it, mirroring
  the `@@location` → `job_region` single-source pattern. Set the project once at the
  master line; a role that ever needs a different project can still override its own
  line (kept for that reason). The master is declared before the roles that reference
  it (BigQuery `DEFAULT` may reference earlier-declared variables). In 03 the master
  is named `default_project_id` specifically to avoid shadowing the `project_id`
  column used in the source-dataset scans. `source_project_filters` in 03 is
  unchanged: physical source tables can span multiple projects by design, so it stays
  an explicit per-source list. In 08 `audit_project_id` also defaults to the master
  but is documented as overridable, since the audit-log sink can live in a separate
  project. Files: `sql/pipeline/03_*`, `sql/setup/01_*`, `sql/validation/04_*`,
  `sql/maintenance/06_*`, `07_*`, `08_*`, and `sql/debug/debug_v_customer_primary_contact.sql`.
  SQL-only; the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Fixed a false `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` for an unqualified array argument in a
  correlated `UNNEST` join, e.g. `FROM t AS a, UNNEST(col1) AS b LEFT JOIN
  UNNEST(col2) AS c` where `col2` is a struct field of `col1`'s element (i.e.
  `b.col2`). Symptom: the unqualified `UNNEST(col2)` reported
  `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` for `COL2` (analysis → COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS), while
  the qualified form `UNNEST(b.col2)` did not. Cause: the reference `col2` is the
  array argument of the third `UNNEST` source `c`, and the candidate set for the
  unqualified name included `c` itself. The physical resolver only treats an
  unqualified name as a preceding `UNNEST`'s element field when exactly one `UNNEST`
  candidate remains (physical_column_resolver.js), but here two were present (`b`
  and the self source `c`), so it fell through to `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`. An
  `UNNEST` array expression can never reference its own element (that would be
  circular). Fix: the column resolver now threads the owning `UNNEST` source id into
  the array-argument reference context and excludes that owning source from the
  unqualified-candidate search (both the value-alias and the general candidate
  lookups). With the self source removed, a single preceding `UNNEST` (`b`) remains
  and the existing correlated-`UNNEST` element-field resolution applies, matching the
  qualified form (the unnested value stays `PARTIALLY_RESOLVED`, a warning, not an
  error). Genuine ambiguity is preserved: with two or more preceding `UNNEST`s the
  unqualified field is still unresolved (no silent guess). Covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_063.js` (unqualified vs qualified parity, the two-preceding-UNNEST
  ambiguity guard, and a top-level-array-column control). Engine change: bundle
  rebuilt (`release_manifest.json` sha256 / size_bytes updated).

- Fixed a false `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` when an `UNNEST` array argument inside
  a correlated subquery references an outer `SELECT` alias and the subquery has two
  or more `UNNEST` sources. Symptom: a view like
  `SELECT g, ARRAY_AGG(col) AS arr FROM t GROUP BY ALL HAVING EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM
  UNNEST(arr) AS a INNER JOIN UNNEST(['x','y']) AS b ON a = b)` reported
  `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` for `arr` (analysis → COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS), even
  though `arr` is the outer aggregate alias, not a physical column. Cause: the
  unqualified array-argument reference `arr` was resolved only against the
  subquery's local sources; those `UNNEST` sources expose an unknown column set at
  the resolver stage, so every one of them was a blanket candidate — with a single
  `UNNEST` it silently (and wrongly) resolved to that source, and with two or more
  it became `AMBIGUOUS`, which the physical resolver then reports as
  `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`. The correlated path to the outer query's `SELECT`
  alias was never tried because output-alias visibility was limited to the
  reference's own clause (`GROUP BY` / `HAVING` / `QUALIFY` / `ORDER BY`) and its
  own scope, whereas the array argument sits in the subquery's `FROM_UNNEST` /
  `JOIN_UNNEST` clause. Fix: for a `UNNEST` array-argument reference with no
  confident local match (no local source that is known to expose the column), the
  column resolver now walks ancestor scopes for a unique matching `SELECT` output
  alias and resolves to it as `SELECT_ALIAS_RESOLVED` (the physical resolver passes
  that through without a physical lookup; the aggregate expression already carries
  the dependency lineage). A known local column still wins (inner scope precedence),
  and non-`UNNEST` clauses are untouched, so `WHERE` / `JOIN ON` resolution is
  unchanged. Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_062.js` (INNER JOIN and comma forms with
  two `UNNEST`s, plus a single-`UNNEST` regression guard). Engine change: bundle
  rebuilt (`release_manifest.json` sha256 / size_bytes updated).

- Scope the STEP 3 column-metadata scan in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` to
  only the source datasets that changed objects actually reference. Previously the
  has-changes gate still loaded COLUMNS / COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS for *every* source
  dataset in the region (the heaviest scan in the run) whenever anything changed,
  even when the day's changes touched a handful of datasets. STEP 3 now runs a
  discovery pre-pass: a `FOR` loop over `changed_datasets` runs the persistent UDF
  in `source_discovery_only` mode once per changed object (per dataset, to bound
  V8 heap), accumulates every row with its `source_discovery_json` into a
  `all_changed_with_discovery` temp table, and collects the referenced source
  dataset names (the dataset segment of each discovered source) into
  `referenced_source_datasets`. The metadata load then unions
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS / COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS only for accessible source
  datasets whose name is referenced (with an empty-but-typed fallback when nothing
  is referenced). This is safe over-inclusion — it never loads less than the
  referenced accessible sources, so lineage resolution is unchanged; it only skips
  datasets no changed object references. The per-dataset analysis loop no longer
  runs its own discovery UDF pass: it reads this dataset's rows back from
  `all_changed_with_discovery` (isolation semantics unchanged — a failing object
  still surfaces only as its own `source_discovery_json` cell and is validated
  per-object). SQL-only change; the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated
  against BigQuery.

- Skip the expensive per-run work in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` when
  nothing changed. The COLUMNS / COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS scan over every source dataset
  (the heaviest scan in the run) was loaded unconditionally in STEP 1 but is only
  consumed by STEP 3 analysis; it now moves into STEP 3 behind a has-changes gate.
  A light registry probe computes `changed_datasets` (datasets with an analyzable
  changed object, mirroring the materialization filter); when it is empty the
  metadata scan and the entire per-dataset analysis loop are skipped, and the loop
  now iterates only those datasets (no empty iterations). STEP 4 impact rebuild is
  gated on `has_analysis_work OR orphan_direct_dep_deleted > 0` (captured via
  `@@row_count` after the direct-dependency orphan DELETE), so it runs only when a
  re-analysis happened or an object was deactivated; an unchanged daily run leaves
  impact as-is. STEP 1 view sync, STEP 2 JOBS sync, and the orphan cleanup still
  run every time (change detection and deactivation handling). SQL-only change;
  the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Added `sql/maintenance/08_view_last_access.sql`, a standalone read-only report
  of each tracked VIEW's last access time, built on BigQuery audit logs sinked to
  BigQuery (new format: `protopayload_auditlog.metadataJson`,
  BigQueryAuditMetadata). It reads
  `$.jobChange.job.jobStats.queryStats.referencedViews`, which identifies the
  VIEW itself (separate from `referencedTables`) — unlike
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS.referenced_tables`, which does not reliably distinguish
  a view from its base tables. Accesses are LEFT JOINed to the definition registry
  so views never queried in the window show `last_accessed_at = NULL`
  (unused-view candidates) alongside the pipeline's `last_seen_at` /
  `last_analyzed_at`. Audit table location, target project, registry name,
  lookback, and dataset include/exclude patterns are DECLAREs; `@@location` must
  match both the audit table and the repository (single-region). Also surfaces the
  accessing job's `data_source_id` label (from
  `$.jobChange.job.jobConfig.labels.data_source_id`) as `last_data_source_id` —
  the value at the most recent access. Documents the legacy-format path, the
  same-region join requirement (with a pure-audit fallback query), retention, and
  the cache-hit caveat. Read-only; not part of the daily pipeline. Not yet
  validated against BigQuery.

- Made `@@location` the single source of truth for the pipeline region in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`. `job_region` is now
  `DECLARE job_region STRING DEFAULT @@location` instead of a duplicated literal,
  so the region is set only at the `SET @@location` line. `@@location` sets the
  job execution location; `job_region` carries the same value as a string for the
  region-qualified INFORMATION_SCHEMA identifiers (`region-<job_region>`), which
  cannot be parameterized. The `ASSERT @@location = job_region` equality check is
  removed (the values can no longer drift); the `job_region` format ASSERT
  remains. Verified in BigQuery that `DEFAULT @@location` is accepted. Applied the
  same single-source treatment to the setup and validation scripts:
  `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` now declares
  `bootstrap_repository_location DEFAULT @@location`, and
  `04_validate_lineage_environment.sql` declares both
  `bootstrap_repository_location` and `bootstrap_target_region`
  `DEFAULT @@location`. 04's "repository and target location match" check (id 20)
  is now structurally guaranteed to PASS and is kept only to surface the resolved
  region in the report.

- Declared and created `render_dynamic_sql` with the same convention as the
  analyze / fingerprint UDFs. 03 now declares `udf_render_function_name` in the
  UDF config block beside `udf_function_name` / `udf_fingerprint_function_name`
  (with a matching name ASSERT); 01 declares `bootstrap_udf_render_function_name`,
  creates the function via `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION \`%s.%s.%s\`` (name no
  longer hardcoded), and reports it as `render_udf` in the setup summary; the
  redeploy helper takes the name from a DECLARE too. No behavior change.

- Relocated the persistent `render_dynamic_sql` to the UDF dataset (alongside
  `analyze_lineage_json`) and made its location DECLARE-configurable in 03.
  `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` now creates it at
  `bootstrap_udf_project_id.bootstrap_udf_dataset` instead of the repository
  dataset; `sql/bigquery/create_render_dynamic_sql_udf.sql` matches. A static
  function reference cannot use a variable for its project/dataset, so 03 no
  longer hardcodes `` `project_id.lineage_repository.render_dynamic_sql` `` at 32
  sites. Instead it builds one reusable dynamic call, `render_call_sql`, right
  after the `repo_tables` block — `SELECT
  `udf_project_id.udf_dataset.udf_render_function_name`(@sql_template, <baked
  config>)` — and every call site runs `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE render_call_sql INTO
  rendered_sql USING sql_template AS sql_template`. The renderer location is now
  driven by the existing `udf_project_id` / `udf_dataset` DECLAREs plus a new
  `udf_render_function_name` DECLARE (default `render_dynamic_sql`); only
  `@sql_template` is bound per call (the fixed config is baked in once), so no
  STRUCT query parameter is needed. SQL-only change; the engine bundle is
  unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Moved `render_dynamic_sql` from a script TEMP FUNCTION in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` to a **persistent SQL function** created by
  `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` in the repository dataset, and made the
  per-step progress markers effective. BigQuery prepends every script TEMP
  FUNCTION's DDL to the query text of every child job, so the console's "All
  results" list showed only that prepended `create temp function
  render_dynamic_sql(` header for every statement — confirmed empirically: even a
  dynamic `SELECT` marker was masked by it. `render_dynamic_sql` is now a
  persistent function; 03 removes the `CREATE TEMP FUNCTION` and calls it by the
  qualified literal `` `project_id.lineage_repository.render_dynamic_sql` `` at all
  32 call sites, so nothing is prepended and each statement shows its own SQL.
  Added `sql/bigquery/create_render_dynamic_sql_udf.sql` to redeploy the function
  in place. Added step-level progress markers (STEP 1/2/4 banners and STEP 3
  per-dataset / discovery / analysis markers) that now surface in "All results".
  Migration: existing environments must recreate the function (re-run 01 setup or
  the new redeploy helper) before running this 03. Keep the qualified literal in 03
  in step with the repository location (bootstrap_repository_project_id /
  bootstrap_repository_dataset in 01). SQL-only change; the engine bundle is
  unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Added a per-iteration progress marker to `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`
  STEP 3. Because `render_dynamic_sql` is a script TEMP FUNCTION, BigQuery
  prepends its `CREATE TEMP FUNCTION` DDL to the query text of every child job
  that calls it, so the console's "All results" list showed only "create temp
  function render_dynamic_sql(" for each statement — and the per-dataset loop
  multiplied those entries. Each loop iteration now runs
  `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FORMAT("SELECT '===== STEP 3 analysis | dataset: %s ====='
  AS processing_target", ds_row.ds)` first, baking the dataset name into the
  executed text so the All results list surfaces which dataset is being
  processed. SQL-only change; the engine bundle is unaffected.

- Replaced the fixed-size UDF chunking in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`
  STEP 3 with a **per-dataset analysis loop**, and removed the chunking. Running
  the per-row JavaScript lineage UDF across every changed object in the region in
  one pass accumulated V8 heap in the per-slot UDF context and hit "Resource
  exceeded during query execution: UDF out of memory" at thousands of objects;
  row-count chunking bounded the invocation count per job but not the aggregate
  memory when large objects clustered in a chunk, so it still OOMed. Operators
  confirmed that analyzing one dataset at a time succeeds, so STEP 3 now wraps the
  change-detection → source-discovery → analysis → direct-dependency publish body
  in `FOR ds_row IN (SELECT ds FROM UNNEST(target_datasets) ... ) DO ... END FOR`,
  scoping the analysis set to a single dataset per iteration via an anchored
  `['^' || ds || '$']` include pattern. The loop list still honors the configured
  `analysis_include_dataset_patterns` / `analysis_exclude_dataset_patterns`.
  Per-dataset scoping shrinks not just the UDF row-batch but every intermediate
  (`changed_definitions_with_discovery`, `batch_object_metadata`,
  `batch_analysis_input`, `batch_udf_results`), which is why one dataset at a time
  stays under the UDF memory ceiling. Both UDF passes (source discovery and STEP 3
  analysis) are back to a single query each — the `discovery_udf_chunk_*` /
  `analysis_udf_chunk_*` DECLAREs, the `udf_chunk` bucket column, and the two
  `WHILE` chunk loops are gone. What stays outside the loop: `target_datasets`
  resolution, the global physical-metadata snapshot (`current_target_columns`,
  loaded once in STEP 1 across all target datasets, so cross-dataset source
  references still resolve), the orphan-row cleanup, and the STEP 4 impact rebuild
  (impact spans datasets, so it runs once after all direct dependencies are
  published). The `analyzed_object_count` / `failed_object_count` counters now
  accumulate across iterations and the run summary is emitted once after the loop.
  Registry status updates were already scoped to the analyzed batch subset
  (`batch_completed_objects` and the failed set), so per-dataset iteration does not
  touch other datasets' rows. SQL-only change; the engine bundle is unaffected.
  Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Also chunked the batch **source-discovery** UDF pass, which the STEP 3 chunking
  had missed. `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` runs the JavaScript UDF a
  second time over every changed definition in `source_discovery_only` mode to
  build `changed_definitions_with_discovery` — a separate single-query UDF pass
  across the whole changed set. At large target counts this pass hits the same
  "UDF out of memory" aggregate ceiling, so lowering `analysis_udf_chunk_size`
  alone did not help (it only chunks the analysis pass). Source discovery now
  runs in fixed-size chunks too: new DECLARE `discovery_udf_chunk_size` (default
  200); `changed_definitions_with_discovery` is created empty via the UDF SELECT
  with `WHERE FALSE`, then filled by one `INSERT ... WHERE discovery_chunk =
  @chunk_index` job per chunk (the chunk is `ROW_NUMBER()` over the changed set
  bucketed by the chunk size, so the UDF runs on at most chunk_size rows per
  job). SQL-only change; the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated
  against BigQuery.

- Ran the STEP 3 lineage UDF in fixed-size chunks instead of one query over all
  analyzable objects, to stop "Resource exceeded during query execution: UDF out
  of memory" as the target set grows. Diagnosis on a failing run: 2667 objects,
  max SQL 64 KB, p50 192 B — no single large object, so the peak is aggregate
  (a single query calling the JavaScript UDF across thousands of rows accumulates
  V8 heap in the per-slot UDF context). The prior metadata slimming did not help
  because memory was not metadata-bound. `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` now
  numbers analyzable rows into buckets of `analysis_udf_chunk_size` (new DECLARE,
  default 200) via a `udf_chunk` column on `batch_analysis_input`, creates
  `batch_udf_results` empty once (the UDF SELECT with `WHERE FALSE`, fixing the
  schema without invoking the UDF), then loops one `INSERT ... WHERE udf_chunk =
  @chunk_index` job per chunk so each job/context runs at most chunk_size
  invocations. Lower the chunk size if OOM persists; raise it to cut per-run job
  overhead. Trade-off: more sequential jobs than the single-query batch. SQL-only
  change; the engine bundle is unaffected. Not yet validated against BigQuery.

- Reduced the per-object physical-column metadata payload passed to the lineage
  UDF in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` STEP 3, to cut the JavaScript UDF's
  peak memory ("Resource exceeded during query execution / UDF out of memory")
  as the analyzed target set grows. The `physical_columns_json` built per object
  now ships only the fields the engine reads — table_name, column_name,
  field_path, ordinal_position — and drops `data_type` and `is_nullable`. The
  engine parses those two but never emits them in the exported output, so results
  are unchanged; a nested/complex `data_type` signature (e.g.
  `ARRAY<STRUCT<...>>` on GA-style event tables) can dominate a column's bytes,
  so removing it materially shrinks the payload for objects over wide/nested
  tables. The METADATA_TOO_LARGE byte guard now measures the same reduced
  payload. SQL-only change; the engine bundle is unaffected. Test:
  test_v1_5_0_061.js locks the contract that engine output is independent of
  data_type/is_nullable.

- Fixed `CREATE ... AS (SELECT ...)` — a CTAS / CREATE VIEW whose body is a
  parenthesized query, e.g. `CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE t AS (SELECT ...)`.
  QueryParser raised `トップレベルのSELECT Clauseが見つかりません。` The unparenthesized
  form `CREATE ... AS SELECT ...` worked because ClauseParser finds the SELECT at
  paren depth 0; with the parentheses the SELECT sits at depth 1, and the existing
  `#stripWrappingParentheses` only unwraps a query that *starts* with `(`, not one
  wrapped after a `CREATE ... AS` prefix. QueryParser now also recognizes a
  statement body of the form `... AS (query)` via `#stripStatementBodyParentheses`
  (a depth-0 `AS` immediately followed by a depth-0 `(` whose matching `)` is the
  last meaningful token, inner starting with SELECT/WITH) and re-parses the inner
  query. The target table name comes from the analysis metadata, so the
  `CREATE ... AS` prefix carries no lineage. `WITH t AS (...) SELECT ...`, column
  aliases `x AS y`, and scalar subqueries `(SELECT ...) AS y` are unaffected.

  441569 bytes), release_manifest.json updated; redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Fixed `INTERVAL <expr> <part>` when the value is an arithmetic expression, e.g.
  `DATE_ADD(d, INTERVAL n * 2 DAY)` / `INTERVAL n + 1 DAY`. As a function argument
  it raised `ExpressionParser: expected ")", but found "day"`; as a bare SELECT
  item it mis-resolved `INTERVAL` as a column (`PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`). A
  literal value like `INTERVAL 2 DAY` and a bare column `INTERVAL n DAY` worked.
  Cause: `#parseIntervalExpression` parsed the value at unary precedence
  (`#parseUnaryExpression`), so it stopped before `*` / `/` / `+` / `-` and left
  the trailing date part unconsumed. The value is now parsed at additive
  precedence (`#parseAdditiveExpression`); the date part is a bare keyword (not an
  operator) so arithmetic parsing always stops just before it and never
  over-consumes. Columns inside the interval value (e.g. `n`) are now kept in the
  lineage. Test: test_v1_5_0_059.js. Engine change: bundle rebuilt (sha256
  81667d37..., 437648 bytes), release_manifest.json updated; redeploy the UDF
  bundle to GCS.

- Fixed `UNNEST(array) WITH OFFSET AS offset` when the offset alias is the
  reserved word `offset`. `SELECT offset FROM t, UNNEST(arr) AS e WITH OFFSET AS
  offset` raised a `OUTPUT_COLUMN_NAME_UNRESOLVED` (WARNING) — the output column
  had no resolvable name — while a non-keyword alias like `pos` worked. The
  offset value itself was fine; only the SELECT output name failed. Cause:
  `offset` is lexed as the `OFFSET` keyword, and SelectParser's implicit
  output-name derivation (`#deriveColumnAlias`) accepted only IDENTIFIER /
  BACKTICK tokens, so it could not name a keyword column — even though
  ExpressionParser already resolves non-reserved keywords as identifier (column)
  references. SelectParser now derives the output name for a single bare column
  token via a new `#isColumnNameToken`, which mirrors ExpressionParser's
  reserved-word set (so `OFFSET` and other non-reserved keywords name the
  column, while `NULL`/`TRUE`/`FALSE` and logical/clause keywords stay unnamed).

- Followed up the v1.5.0-056 `JOIN ... USING(col)` fix for the case where the
  USING key is not present in the FROM/left source. v1.5.0-056 resolved an
  unqualified USING column to the first (FROM/left) candidate, but a USING key
  need only exist in one of the joined sources — a physical FROM table may not
  contain it (e.g. `SELECT cola FROM tablea INNER JOIN aaa USING(id) INNER JOIN
  bbb USING(cola)` where `cola` lives in the CTEs `aaa`/`bbb`, not in `tablea`).
  Resolving to `tablea` then raised `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`. ColumnResolver
  now prefers the first candidate that is known to expose the column (a CTE /
  derived source whose output includes it, i.e. `#getColumnStatus` == RESOLVED),
  falling back to the first candidate only when none is definitively known to
  expose it (all sources physical / schema-not-yet-linked). The join key traces
  to that source (here `cola` → the CTE → its physical source). Test:
  test_v1_5_0_057.js. Engine change: bundle rebuilt (sha256 397fb7e4...,
  435847 bytes), release_manifest.json updated; redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Fixed a false `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_AMBIGUOUS` (ERROR) on the join key of a
  `JOIN ... USING(col)` when the column is referenced unqualified and exists in
  two or more join sources (reported case: two `INNER JOIN`s, all sources CTEs,
  joined with `USING`, no column qualification). The parser recorded the USING
  columns in `join.using_columns`, but the resolver ignored them: SourceResolver
  did not carry USING info onto the scope, and ColumnResolver flagged any
  unqualified column found in 2+ sources as AMBIGUOUS. `USING(col)` merges the
  join key into a single logical column, so such a reference is not ambiguous.
  SourceResolver now records the normalized USING column names on
  `scope.join_using_columns`, and ColumnResolver resolves an unqualified USING
  column deterministically to the first (FROM/left) candidate source instead of
  AMBIGUOUS. Lineage for the join key is attributed to the left source (full
  dual-source union attribution would be a larger change). Genuine ambiguity via
  an `ON` join (same column name in both sources, no USING) still errors. Test:
  test_v1_5_0_056.js. Engine change: bundle rebuilt (sha256 2480400b...,
  435251 bytes), release_manifest.json updated; redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Added a `labels ARRAY<STRUCT<key STRING, value STRING>>` column to
  `lineage_definition_registry` so a FAILED object can be traced to its source
  DAG (dag_id, task_id, ...) without joining to the job registry. Populated in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` STEP 2 from the source job's labels
  (carried through `latest_generated_table_definitions` into the generated-table
  definition-registry MERGE, both the matched UPDATE and the not-matched INSERT).
  Views are unaffected — STEP 1 leaves `labels` unset, so it defaults to NULL.
  The job registry already stored `labels`; this copies them onto the analyzable
  object row. SQL-only change; the engine bundle is unaffected. MIGRATION: 01
  uses CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE (which would drop data), so on an existing
  deployment do NOT re-run 01 — instead `ALTER TABLE <definition_registry> ADD
  COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS labels ARRAY<STRUCT<key STRING, value STRING>>;` and the
  next daily run backfills labels for generated TABLEs.

- Fixed named parameters whose name collides with a clause keyword — @limit,
  @order, @where, @group, @from, @offset, @select — which failed even though
  v1.5.0-052 added @name handling. The lexer emitted '@' and the name as two
  tokens, so the ClauseParser saw the bare keyword token and mistook that
  position for the start of a clause (e.g. "LimitParser: body_start_seq must be
  an integer" for `a = @limit`). The lexer now reads @name / @@name as a single
  PARAMETER token (normalized with the '@', e.g. '@LIMIT'), so it never collides
  with a clause keyword; the expression parser consumes the PARAMETER token as a
  no-lineage literal. Test: test_v1_5_0_055.js. Engine change: bundle rebuilt
  (sha256 7d567a23..., 433565 bytes), release_manifest.json updated; redeploy the
  UDF bundle to GCS.

- Fixed three parser gaps seen in JOBS-collected SQL. (1) Typed STRUCT / ARRAY
  constructors — `STRUCT<f1 T1, f2 T2>(v1, v2)`, `ARRAY<STRUCT<...>>[...]`. The
  angle-bracket type list was read as comparisons, which broke array literals
  ("expected \"]\", but found \"STRING\".") and, for a top-level SELECT item,
  split the item on the comma inside `<...>` so the type field names were
  harvested as columns. Now `STRUCT<...>(...)` / `ARRAY<...>[...]` parse with the
  type skipped (no lineage) and the value/element lineage kept, and the SELECT
  item splitter tracks STRUCT/ARRAY angle depth so `<...>` commas no longer split
  items (plain comparisons `a < b, c > d` are unaffected). (2) A whole query
  wrapped in parentheses — `(SELECT ...)` — reported "トップレベルのSELECT Clauseが
  見つかりません。"; QueryParser now strips a matched outer paren pair (re-normalizing
  paren depth) and re-parses, while `(SELECT ...) UNION ALL (SELECT ...)` is still
  split rather than unwrapped. (3) A parenthesized tuple / row value — `(a, b) IN
  (SELECT ...)` or `(a, b) IN ((1,2),(3,4))` — reported "expected \")\", but found
  \",\"."; the parenthesized-expression parser now returns an EXPRESSION_LIST that
  keeps every element's lineage. Test: `test_v1_5_0_054.js`. Engine change: bundle
  rebuilt (sha256 a4a43b2c…, 433278 bytes), `release_manifest.json` updated;
  redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Parsed EXTRACT and the WEEK(<WEEKDAY>) date part correctly. `EXTRACT(part FROM
  expr [AT TIME ZONE tz])` was not handled as a special form: in a SELECT item it
  survived via the RAW_EXPRESSION fallback, but in a WHERE / nested context it
  threw "ExpressionParser: expected \")\", but found \"FROM\"." (PARTIAL_FAILURE),
  and identifier-typed tokens inside were mis-harvested as columns — the weekday
  in `EXTRACT(WEEK(MONDAY) FROM dt)` and the `AT` of `AT TIME ZONE` both raised a
  spurious PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND. Separately, `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)` as a
  DATE_TRUNC granularity (`DATE_TRUNC(dt, WEEK(MONDAY))`) mis-harvested the
  weekday too. EXTRACT is now parsed as `EXTRACT(datepart FROM source [AT TIME
  ZONE tz])`: the datepart (including `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)`) carries no lineage, while
  the source expression and any time-zone expression carry lineage (so
  `AT TIME ZONE tz_column` captures tz). `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)` parses as a no-lineage
  date part wherever it appears. Bare dateparts as ordinary function arguments
  (`DATE_TRUNC(dt, WEEK)`, `DATE_DIFF(a, b, DAY)`) are unaffected. Test:
  `test_v1_5_0_053.js`. Engine change: bundle rebuilt (sha256 ea17ae4c…, 426507
  bytes), `release_manifest.json` updated; redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Handled BigQuery named query parameters `@name` (and `@@system_variable`) in
  the expression parser, e.g. dbt-style `@key` placeholders that appear in
  JOBS-collected SQL. The lexer emits `@` as its own token and the parser had no
  primary for it, so `WHERE c = @key` threw "ExpressionParser: token \"@\" cannot
  start an expression" (PARTIAL_FAILURE), and `SELECT @key` degraded to
  RAW_EXPRESSION and mis-harvested the parameter name as a bare column (spurious
  PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND). `@name` / `@@name` now parse as a LITERAL_EXPRESSION
  of kind "PARAMETER": a parameter is an external scalar value, not a table
  column, so it carries no lineage. The name after `@` is consumed even when it
  is a reserved keyword (`@end`, `@order` are valid parameter names). Real column
  lineage in the same statement is preserved. Test: `test_v1_5_0_052.js`. Engine
  change: bundle rebuilt (sha256 ff86d618…, 424573 bytes), `release_manifest.json`
  updated; redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Fixed "FromParser: JOIN was expected, but found \"-\"." for an unquoted dashed
  table path in FROM — most commonly a dashed project id, e.g.
  `FROM my-project.dataset.table` or `my-project-123.dataset.table`. The lexer
  splits `my-project` into `my` `-` `project`, and FromParser#parseTableSource
  only walked '.'-separated parts, so it stopped at the first '-' and reported a
  spurious JOIN-expected error (PARTIAL_FAILURE). Two changes: (1)
  FromParser#parseTableSource now merges hyphen-joined tokens (and numeric
  segments) into one path part (`my - project` -> MY-PROJECT); (2) the lexer no
  longer swallows a '.' into a number when the '.' is immediately followed by an
  identifier-start character, so `my-project-123.dataset` tokenizes as `123` `.`
  `dataset` (path separator) rather than `123.` `dataset`. Real float literals
  (1.5, 1., 1.5e3, 3.14) are unaffected, and backtick-quoted paths
  (`` `my-project.d.t` ``) already worked. Known limitation: a segment that mixes
  digits and letters with no separator (e.g. `my-2nd`) is still mis-lexed;
  backtick-quote such paths. Test: `test_v1_5_0_051.js`. Engine change: bundle
  rebuilt (sha256 526f9433…, 422958 bytes), `release_manifest.json` updated;
  redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Fixed "SelectParser: SELECT item 1 has no expression" for a string literal
  whose contents spell a SELECT set-quantifier, e.g. `SELECT 'ALL' AS col1`.
  SelectParser#removeSelectModifiers strips a leading SELECT ALL / SELECT DISTINCT
  quantifier (and the AS STRUCT / AS VALUE modifier) before the first item's
  expression is parsed, but it matched on normalized_token alone. A string literal
  `'ALL'` / `'DISTINCT'` (token_type STRING, normalized_token "ALL"/"DISTINCT")
  was mistaken for the quantifier and stripped, leaving the first item with no
  expression (PARTIAL_FAILURE). The modifier checks now also require
  token_type === "KEYWORD", so a quoted string is never treated as a modifier;
  genuine SELECT ALL / DISTINCT / AS STRUCT|VALUE are unaffected. Test:
  `test_v1_5_0_050.js`. Engine change: bundle rebuilt (sha256 2d485eb…, 420900
  bytes), `release_manifest.json` updated; redeploy the UDF bundle to GCS.

- Fixed a spurious PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND for field access on a function-call
  result, e.g. the GA4 pattern `fn('key', event_params).string_value`. The
  postfix parser handled `OVER` and array subscripts `[ ... ]` but not a `.field`
  access following a completed value expression (a function call, a parenthesized
  expression, or a subscript). Such an item degraded to RAW_EXPRESSION, which
  harvested the trailing field name as a bare unqualified column reference, so
  `.string_value` was resolved against the physical tables, not found, and raised
  an ERROR (COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS -> non-publishable / FAILED) even though
  `string_value` is a nested struct field, not a top-level column. The parser now
  parses `base.field` on a call/parenthesized/subscript result. Mirroring the
  array-subscript design (position keywords carry no lineage), the accessed field
  selects from an opaque/derived value (the function's return STRUCT) and carries
  NO physical-column lineage; only the base expression's lineage is kept — so the
  output still depends on the function argument (`event_params`, broadly all of
  its collected field paths) and the trailing `.string_value` no longer resolves
  as a column. Identifier chains like `event_params.value.string_value` (a struct
  field path on a real column) are unaffected — they are consumed before the
  postfix stage. Test: `test_v1_5_0_049.js`. Engine change: bundle rebuilt
  (sha256 b14244de…, 420340 bytes), `release_manifest.json` updated; redeploy the
  UDF bundle to GCS.

- Stopped treating a generated/DAG table as FAILED when the only problem is that
  a source it references no longer exists. Such sources (temporary or short-lived
  tables) have no collected columns, so the engine reports PHYSICAL_METADATA_NOT_
  FOUND / SOURCE_METADATA_NOT_COLLECTED (WARNING), which alone pushed the object
  to COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS -> non-publishable -> registry FAILED, a
  UDF_RESULT_NOT_PUBLISHABLE diagnostic, and is_changed = TRUE (retried every
  run). STEP 3 now distinguishes the two causes using INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  (new `batch_object_source_flags`): a discovered source absent from
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES is genuinely gone (expected), while a source present
  in TABLES but with no collected columns is a real coverage gap. An analyzed
  object is now publishable when its status is exactly COMPLETED, OR
  COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS with no present-but-uncollected source (i.e. its
  warnings are explained entirely by absent sources). Publishable objects finish
  normally: resolved dependencies are published, the absent-source warnings are
  NOT written to lineage_diagnostic, registry -> COMPLETED with is_changed =
  FALSE (no more retries). Objects with a real ERROR (e.g. a column missing from
  a source that DOES exist -> PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND), a PARTIAL_FAILURE, or a
  present-but-uncollected source are unchanged (still surfaced and FAILED). Note:
  an object that mixes an absent-source warning with an independent real error
  stays FAILED and keeps all of its diagnostics. SQL-only change (STEP 3 publish
  classification); the engine bundle is unaffected. As with the other STEP 3
  work, validate on BigQuery before production.

- Added dataset-level counterparts to the registry and analysis name filters in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`, so filtering can now target whole datasets
  in addition to object names. New parameters (all default `[]` = no effect):
  `registry_exclude_dataset_patterns`, `analysis_include_dataset_patterns`,
  `analysis_exclude_dataset_patterns`. Semantics: REGISTRY-stage exclusion drops
  an object when its name matches any `registry_exclude_object_patterns` entry OR
  its dataset matches any `registry_exclude_dataset_patterns` entry (STEP 1 Views
  on object_dataset, STEP 2 generated TABLEs on destination_dataset). ANALYSIS-
  stage selection now gates name and dataset independently: an object is analyzed
  when (name-include empty OR name matches) AND (dataset-include empty OR dataset
  matches) AND it matches no name-exclude AND no dataset-exclude. All matching is
  the existing case-insensitive `REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(value), LOWER(pattern))`.
  The existing `*_object_patterns` behavior is unchanged, and because every new
  array defaults to empty, runtimes that do not set them are unaffected. SQL-only
  change; the engine bundle is unaffected.

- Rewrote STEP 3 of `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` from a per-object
  `FOR ... DO` loop into a fully set-based batch pipeline. The loop previously
  ran ~15-20 EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statements per changed object (two UDF calls plus
  metadata scoping, staging, and per-object DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE), i.e. ~15-20N
  serial BigQuery jobs for N changed objects. The batch form runs a fixed,
  N-independent set of statements: (1) scope physical-column metadata for all
  objects in one query; (2) invoke the persistent lineage UDF once across every
  analyzable object (`batch_udf_results`), paying the JavaScript UDF
  initialization cost once for the whole run; (3) stage dependencies and
  diagnostics for all objects with set queries; (4) publish with a handful of
  set-based DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE statements keyed by object-key temp tables
  (`batch_completed_objects` / `batch_udf_failed_objects` /
  `batch_preanalysis_failures`). On a run with N changed objects this collapses
  the STEP 3 job count from ~15-20N to a small constant.
  SEMANTICS PRESERVED: COMPLETED objects replace their direct dependencies and
  diagnostics; non-COMPLETED UDF results keep their last known-good dependencies
  (ADR-0004) while diagnostics are replaced and a UDF_RESULT_NOT_PUBLISHABLE row
  is recorded; pre-analysis failures (source discovery not COMPLETE, or scoped
  metadata over the single-call limit) leave dependencies untouched, append an
  ANALYSIS_EXECUTION_FAILED diagnostic, and mark the registry FAILED. The
  non_completed_udf_results result set is populated as before.
  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: publication is now batch-atomic instead of per-object. All
  staging is computed before any write; the destructive DML runs in a block that
  restores the affected direct_dependency / lineage_diagnostic rows from
  pre-publish backups and re-raises on any error, so a failed run leaves the
  repository unchanged rather than partially updated. A single object can no
  longer be committed while a sibling is skipped mid-run. Because the UDF returns
  analysis_status instead of throwing, per-object analysis failures remain
  isolated as data. SQL-only change; the engine bundle is unaffected.
  VALIDATION: this rewrite has not yet been executed against BigQuery from this
  environment. Before production use, run a dry-run parse and a staging run, and
  diff its direct_dependency / lineage_diagnostic / definition_registry output
  against the previous per-object pipeline on the same changed set.

- Sped up STEP 3 by hoisting source discovery out of the per-object loop in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`. The persistent UDF is a per-row scalar
  function, so source_discovery_only mode is now run ONCE across every changed
  definition (new `changed_definitions_with_discovery` temp table:
  `SELECT ..., UDF(definition_text, '[]', {source_discovery_only:TRUE}, NULL)
  FROM changed_definitions_to_analyze`) instead of a separate per-object UDF
  query inside the loop. The loop now reads `target.source_discovery_json`
  directly, so the object's UDF invocations drop from two (discovery + full
  analysis) to one, and the JavaScript UDF initialization cost for discovery is
  paid a single time per run rather than once per changed object. On a run with
  N changed objects this removes N-1 discovery jobs (2N → N+1 UDF jobs total)
  plus N-1 UDF cold starts. BEHAVIOR NOTE: no functional change. Per-object
  isolation is preserved because source_discovery_only never throws — it returns
  analysis_status = 'PARTIAL_FAILURE' with an error payload for a failing object,
  so the loop's existing status check + RAISE still routes that object to its own
  EXCEPTION handler (previous dependency rows preserved per ADR-0004). SQL-only
  change; the engine bundle is unaffected.

- Renamed the three name-based object filters in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` so the parameter name states which stage it
  acts on — and therefore whether a matched object is merely skipped for analysis
  or kept out of the registry entirely — and made both filter families
  consistently object-scoped. Mapping:
  `include_object_patterns` → `analysis_include_object_patterns`,
  `exclude_object_patterns` → `analysis_exclude_object_patterns`,
  `exclude_view_name_patterns` → `registry_exclude_object_patterns`. The
  `analysis_*` pair gates only lineage analysis (matched objects stay registered
  and keep change tracking; applies to VIEWs and, when
  process_generated_tables = TRUE, generated TABLEs). `registry_exclude_object_patterns`
  keeps matched objects out of the registry entirely: Views are dropped in STEP 1
  before entering the definition registry (an already-registered View is
  deactivated), and — newly — generated TABLEs are dropped in STEP 2 (matched on
  the destination table name) before entering the job / definition registry, so
  the filter is now genuinely object-scoped rather than VIEW-only. The
  `registry_*` DECLARE is now ordered before the `analysis_*` DECLAREs to match
  execution order (collection/STEP 1 precedes analysis/STEP 3-4). The dynamic-SQL
  bind names (`@include_patterns` / `@exclude_patterns`) are unchanged. BEHAVIOR
  NOTE: the only behavior change is that `registry_exclude_object_patterns` now
  also filters generated tables in STEP 2; because all three default to `[]`
  (exclude nothing / analyze all), a runtime that leaves them empty is unaffected.
  MIGRATION: if you set any of these in your runtime copy, rename them to the new
  identifiers (values and semantics for the `analysis_*` pair are unchanged; the
  former view-name exclusion now also applies to generated-table names). SQL-only
  change; the engine bundle is unaffected.

- Fixed column resolution for mixed qualified/unqualified references across a
  `SELECT *` CTE that is joined to another source. A CTE whose body is
  `SELECT * FROM <physical_table>` exposes an *unknown* set of columns at the
  name-resolution stage (the `*` pulls in physical columns that are only known
  once metadata is applied), but the ColumnResolver treated it as exposing *zero*
  columns. When such a CTE was the FROM side of a `LEFT JOIN` against a physical
  table (both aliased), an unqualified column belonging to the CTE was bound to
  the JOIN side and reported `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` (no rescue fired, because
  a wrong single candidate had already been selected), and even a *qualified*
  reference into the CTE (`x.col`) was reported `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN`. Root cause:
  `#getWildcardExposedColumns` skipped physical/UNNEST sources, so a wildcard over
  them collapsed to an empty column set instead of "unknown". Fix: a wildcard that
  pulls from a source whose columns are unknown (physical table, UNNEST, or an
  unknown child scope) now propagates "unknown" (`null`) rather than an empty set,
  so the CTE stays a candidate source and the physical resolver disambiguates the
  reference using real metadata. Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_048.js`. Engine
  change → the bundle was rebuilt; re-upload `lineage_udf_bundle.js` to GCS (no
  SQL change).
- Added array element access (subscript) parsing to the expression engine.
  Previously the parser handled only the `OVER` postfix, so
  `array_expr[OFFSET(n)]`, `[SAFE_OFFSET(n)]`, `[ORDINAL(n)]`, `[SAFE_ORDINAL(n)]`
  (and a generic `[expr]`) raised a parse error. Postfix `[...]` is now parsed:
  the position keyword itself carries no lineage, and the element value traces to
  the array expression's source column(s); a column referenced inside the index is
  also captured. Works in SELECT, WHERE, etc., and chains. Covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_047.js`. Engine change → the bundle was rebuilt; re-upload
  `lineage_udf_bundle.js` to GCS (no SQL change).
- Made all dataset/object name regex filters in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` case-insensitive. Previously the name side
  was lowercased but the pattern was not, so an uppercase pattern never matched a
  (lowercased) name and the dataset/object was silently dropped. Now both sides
  are lowercased (`REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(name), LOWER(pattern))`), so a pattern
  matches regardless of the case it is written in. Applies to
  `source_project_filters` (dataset_include/exclude_patterns),
  `target_dataset_include/exclude_patterns`, `exclude_view_name_patterns`, and
  `include_object_patterns` / `exclude_object_patterns`.
- Tidied dead configuration in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` (no behavior
  change). Removed the two unused `render_dynamic_sql` placeholders `__REPOSITORY__`
  and `__TARGET__` (no template referenced them), and removed the now-vestigial
  `target_dataset` scalar that existed only to build `__TARGET__` — its DECLARE,
  its SET, the `render_dynamic_sql` parameter, and the argument at all 37 call
  sites. The renderer is now 8 placeholders / 9 parameters. `target_datasets`
  (plural, the resolved scan scope) and the direct-dependency `target_dataset`
  column are unchanged.
- Unified dataset filtering on regex and tidied the environment block in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`. `source_project_filters` now uses
  `dataset_include_patterns` / `dataset_exclude_patterns` (`ARRAY<STRING>` regex,
  matched via `REGEXP_CONTAINS` on the lowercased name, multiple patterns per
  list) instead of the previous single LIKE `dataset_filter` / `dataset_exclude`,
  so it matches the `target_dataset_*_patterns` convention added above — the whole
  pipeline now selects datasets by regex. Empty include list = every dataset in
  the region; empty exclude = exclude none. MIGRATION: rewrite existing source
  patterns from LIKE to regex (e.g. `dataset_filter = '%sales%'` →
  `dataset_include_patterns = [r'sales']`; `'%'` / all → `[]`). Also moved
  `job_region` to the top of the runtime environment settings (it is the
  single region for repository, target Views, source metadata, and JOBS, and must
  equal `SET @@location`).
- `target_datasets` (the View analysis scope in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`) is now resolved by region + regex instead
  of an explicit list. Two new parameters, `target_dataset_include_patterns` and
  `target_dataset_exclude_patterns` (`ARRAY<STRING>` of regex, default empty),
  drive a scan of the target project's datasets in `job_region`
  (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA`): a dataset is kept when it matches ANY include
  pattern (or include is empty = all) AND matches NO exclude pattern
  (`REGEXP_CONTAINS`, lowercased). The resolved list feeds the existing STEP 1
  View collection and the View not-found deactivation exactly as before. (JOBS
  collection is unchanged — it is region-scoped and never used `target_datasets`.)
  Note: this affects `03` only; `01`/`04`/`05` keep their own `bootstrap_*`
  values, which are used for the setup smoke test and validation, not the scan.
- Added a collection-stage VIEW name exclusion in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`: `exclude_view_name_patterns`
  (`ARRAY<STRING>` of regex, default empty). In STEP 1, any View whose name
  matches ANY pattern (partial match via `REGEXP_CONTAINS` on the lowercased name)
  is dropped from `current_view_definitions` before the registry MERGE, so it
  never enters the definition registry; a previously-registered View that now
  matches is deactivated by the existing STEP 1 not-found rule. This is stronger
  than `exclude_object_patterns` (which keeps the row and only skips analysis).
  Example — exclude names ending in a digit and names containing "test":
  `[r'[0-9]$', r'test']`.
- Analyze each structurally-identical JOBS SQL once, keyed by a literal-normalized
  fingerprint, splitting on whether the destination table persists. Engine: added
  `fingerprintSqlForBigQuery(sql)` — it lexes the SQL, replaces STRING/NUMBER
  literals with `?`, drops comments, and normalizes identifier/keyword case,
  returning a canonical string; SQL that differs only in literals yields the same
  fingerprint, structural differences a different one (covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_046.js`). Setup (01): registers a companion persistent scalar
  UDF `fingerprint_lineage_sql(sql)` from the same GCS bundle, and adds
  `sql_fingerprint` and `is_ephemeral` columns to the definition registry plus
  `sql_fingerprint` to the job registry. Pipeline (03): computes `sql_fingerprint`
  for every collected job, then builds the representative set with a split:
    - PERSISTENT — the destination table exists AND has no table expiration set:
      kept per destination with its real identity, so a downstream object
      referencing it still chains through it (e.g.
      `CREATE TABLE dst AS SELECT * FROM view`). `definition_hash` stays the
      SHA256 of the definition text. `is_ephemeral = FALSE`. Deactivated when no
      matching non-expiring table remains (dropped, or an expiration was added).
    - EPHEMERAL — the destination does not exist, OR it exists but has an
      `expiration_timestamp` (temp / rotating-name jobs such as
      `CREATE TEMP TABLE AS SELECT`, an expiring dated table, or a scheduled
      `SELECT` whose result lands in a rotating anonymous table): collapsed by
      fingerprint to one stable
      synthetic object `<target_project>.<ephemeral_object_dataset_label>.fp_<hash>`
      (default label `ephemeral_generated_sql`), analyzed once. `definition_hash`
      is set to the fingerprint (a later literal-only change does not re-trigger
      analysis), `is_ephemeral = TRUE`. Because the identity is fingerprint-stable,
      a recurring job refreshes the same row (no churn); it is aged out
      (`is_active = FALSE`, `INACTIVE_FINGERPRINT_NOT_SEEN`) when its fingerprint
      stops appearing in JOBS within the lookback window.
  Table expiration is read by joining `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_OPTIONS`
  (`option_name = 'expiration_timestamp'`) into `current_target_tables`. This lets
  temp/rotating DAG jobs — including ones that write to real but expiring dated
  tables — be analyzed exactly once, while preserving per-destination traceability
  for real, non-expiring generated tables. Views are unchanged and
  always analyzed individually. Edge case: two *distinct persistent* tables with a
  byte-identical fingerprint are still kept separate (each exists); only
  non-persistent destinations are collapsed. NOTE: because 01 recreates the
  repository tables (`CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE`) to add the new columns, re-run 01
  after upgrading; an existing `lineage_job_registry` reached only through 03's
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` will not gain the column on its own.

- Retired the typed `lineage_config` table. It was not a functional dependency of
  the daily pipeline — `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` already declared all
  runtime settings itself and never read the table — so it only duplicated values
  already set elsewhere. `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` no longer creates,
  seeds, or reads it (section 2 is now bootstrap validation; the setup steps use
  the `bootstrap_*` values directly for the UDF, smoke test, and summary).
  `04_validate_lineage_environment.sql` no longer loads the config row (the
  "lineage_config table exists" check was removed); its checks now compare the
  live repository against the script's own `bootstrap_*` expected values.
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` dropped the unused `__T_CONFIG__`
  placeholder / `table_config` / `repo_tables.config`, and
  `05_repository_integration_test.sql` reads the impact-rank cap from a bootstrap
  parameter instead of the table. Note: shared scalars (repository/UDF
  project·dataset·location) still appear in both 01 and 03 because they are
  separate scripts; the table did not unify them (03 ignored it), so removing it
  drops an unused third copy rather than adding duplication.

- Moved execution service-account configuration into the pipeline and retired the
  `lineage_execution_account_config` table. `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`
  now declares `scheduled_query_service_accounts` and `dag_service_accounts` in a
  new top-level STEP 2 parameter block instead of reading them from the
  repository table (the table load + `__T_EXEC_ACCOUNT__` placeholder were
  removed). `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` no longer creates/seeds that table
  (section 3 removed) and `04_validate_lineage_environment.sql` no longer
  validates it (result ids 22-24 removed); stale references in
  `06_analyze_changed_objects.sql` and the integration test plan were updated. The
  whole pipeline is now configured in a single file.
- Parameterized the meaningful JOBS-extraction knobs in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` (top-level DECLAREs): `initial_lookback_days`
  / `incremental_lookback_days` (hoisted from STEP 2), `collected_statement_types`
  (was a hardcoded `statement_type IN ('SELECT','CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')`, now an
  `IN UNNEST(@statement_types)` array parameter), and `require_scheduled_query_label`
  (when FALSE, Scheduled Query jobs are classified by service account alone).
  Correctness invariants (`job_type = 'QUERY'`, `state = 'DONE'`,
  `error_result IS NULL`, non-null `query` / `destination_table`) remain hardcoded
  in the WHERE clause by design.

- Sanitized environment-identifying strings across the entire tree. The concrete
  project id was replaced with the placeholder `project_id` (uppercase
  `PROJECT_ID`), the concrete dataset with `dataset` (uppercase `DATASET`), the
  concrete GCS bundle bucket/path with `gs://YOUR_BUCKET/YOUR_PATH/...`, and an
  illustrative include/exclude regex example with `r'^stg_'`. Service-account
  defaults became `project_id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. Applied to SQL, docs,
  and test fixtures/golden expected outputs alike; the JS engine `src/` never
  contained these strings, so the bundle is byte-for-byte unchanged. All release +
  golden tests pass with the placeholders.
- Setup (`sql/setup/01_setup_lineage_environment.sql`): repository tables are now
  created with `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` instead of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  (config, execution-account config, definition registry, direct dependency,
  impact, diagnostic, and job registry), so a re-run rebuilds the table schemas
  in place. Note: `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` drops and recreates each table, so
  any existing rows are removed on re-run — the `MERGE` seeds re-populate the
  configuration tables, but the transactional lineage tables start empty.
- Setup (`sql/setup/01_setup_lineage_environment.sql`): dataset (`CREATE SCHEMA`)
  creation is now disabled (commented out) for both the repository (table)
  dataset and the UDF/function dataset. Both datasets are expected to already
  exist; the script now only creates/replaces the tables and the UDF within
  them. The blocks are left in place (commented) so they can be re-enabled if
  needed.

- Stopped reporting `WITH RECURSIVE` self-references as a false cycle. A recursive
  CTE's recursive term legitimately references the CTE itself
  (`... UNION ALL SELECT a.itm_cd FROM cte_rec a JOIN cte_c b ...`); the lineage
  resolver's cycle guard flagged the re-entry as `CYCLE_DETECTED`, producing a
  false `PARTIALLY_RESOLVED` ("Unresolved: a.itm_cd @scope N [cycle detected]").
  Recursive CTE body scopes are now tracked (from the `recursive` flag the source
  resolver already records), and re-entry into a recursive CTE's own output
  terminates benignly (`NO_COLUMN_DEPENDENCY`) — the base term supplies the
  lineage and the recursive term adds no new physical source. Non-recursive
  re-entry still yields `CYCLE_DETECTED`. Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_045.js`.

- Hardened derived-scope resolution against a false `CYCLE_DETECTED` on
  self-joined CTEs. A qualified reference into a self-joined CTE
  (`table_a AS x LEFT JOIN table_a AS y`, `y.col`) could have its derived scope
  resolved to the referencing scope itself; the existing self-reference
  correction only fired when the scope had exactly one local derived source, so a
  self-join (two derived sources sharing one child scope) fell through and
  produced a self-cycle (`col_a → col_b @scope N [CYCLE_DETECTED]`,
  PARTIALLY_RESOLVED). The resolver now discards a derived scope equal to the
  referencing scope (impossible in a non-recursive query) and selects the derived
  source by the reference qualifier, falling back to the sole / single-child-scope
  derived source (preserving the PIVOT-in-outer-subquery case). Covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_044.js`.

- Parsed aggregate / navigation function argument suffixes. `IGNORE NULLS` /
  `RESPECT NULLS` (and an aggregate `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT` / `HAVING MAX|MIN`)
  inside a function call were not handled, so strict parsing failed and the raw
  fallback treated `IGNORE` / `RESPECT` as a column
  (`PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` / "Unresolved: IGNORE"). `#parseFunctionCall` now
  consumes these suffixes: NULL treatment and `LIMIT` carry no lineage, while
  `ORDER BY` / `HAVING MAX|MIN` expressions are captured as dependencies. Covers
  `ARRAY_AGG(x IGNORE NULLS ORDER BY ts LIMIT 5)`,
  `FIRST_VALUE(x IGNORE NULLS) OVER (...)`, `STRING_AGG(x, sep ORDER BY y)`, and
  `ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT x IGNORE NULLS)`. Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_043.js`.

- Allowed conditionless `[LEFT|INNER] JOIN UNNEST(...)` and added array-literal
  parsing. BigQuery permits a correlated UNNEST join without ON/USING, but the
  FromParser only allowed it when the array expression textually referenced a
  visible source name, so a bare/unqualified array column
  (`LEFT JOIN UNNEST(items)`), a no-left-alias form, or a CTE-column array raised
  `FromParser: LEFT JOIN requires ON or USING condition.`. Any non-CROSS join
  whose right source is `UNNEST` may now omit the condition; ordinary joins still
  require ON/USING. Array literals `[ ... ]` (e.g. `UNNEST([1,2,3])`,
  `SELECT [STRUCT(...)]` in a strict-parse context) now parse as expressions.
  Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_042.js`.

- Resolved field access over `UNNEST(<column>)` and stopped reporting
  constant/no-physical dependencies as PARTIALLY_RESOLVED. Field access on an
  UNNEST of a bare column previously stopped at `UNNEST_DEFERRED` and surfaced as
  a false `PARTIALLY_RESOLVED` (which propagated downstream, e.g. into
  `ROW_NUMBER() ... PARTITION BY`). Now `#resolveCorrelatedUnnestReference`
  resolves the element field against the array's owning source: a physical
  repeated STRUCT (GA4 `UNNEST(event_params)` with `ep.key`,
  `ep.value.string_value`, or the no-alias bare `key`/`value`) resolves to the
  nested `field_path` (`event_params.key`, …); an UNNEST over a STRUCT-literal or
  other derived array (e.g. `WITH cte AS (SELECT [STRUCT('v' AS aaa, ...)] AS str)
  ... FROM cte, UNNEST(str)`) has no upstream physical column, so its element
  fields resolve as constants. An unqualified field with no matching physical or
  derived sibling but exactly one UNNEST source in scope is routed to that UNNEST.
  In the lineage resolver, the "resolved but no physical dependency" statuses
  (`UNNEST_CONSTANT`, `UNNEST_OFFSET`, `PSEUDO_COLUMN_RESOLVED`) now become a
  RESOLVED constant dependency (no physical edge, no warning) instead of an
  unresolved dependency. Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_041.js`.

- Resolved nested STRUCT field references (e.g. GA4 `geo.region`,
  `device.web_info.browser`). The ColumnResolver reads `a.b` as qualifier `a` /
  column `b` and, finding no source aliased `a`, marked it UNRESOLVED_SOURCE, so
  nested fields never resolved even though `COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS` metadata was
  collected and present. The PhysicalColumnResolver now resolves a qualified,
  otherwise-unresolved reference as a STRUCT field path by matching the full
  `reference_name` against a scope source's `field_path` metadata (works for
  arbitrary depth). For an alias-qualified reference (`t.geo.region`) that already
  resolved to a source, the leading alias is stripped and the remaining path is
  matched exactly against `field_path`, so it resolves to just `geo.region`
  instead of also attaching the top-level `geo` struct column. Covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_040.js`. (COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS was already collected by
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`; this was an engine resolution gap.)

- Fixed wildcard-table (GA4 `events_*`) metadata scoping in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`. Source discovery returns the wildcard name
  verbatim (e.g. `project.analytics_123.events_*`), but the per-view metadata
  scoping (`discovered_metadata_tables`) matched discovered sources to metadata by
  exact name equality, so `events_*` never matched a shard (`events_20240101`) and
  the UDF received no columns → `PHYSICAL_METADATA_NOT_FOUND`. The scoping step now
  matches wildcard sources against shard tables by pattern (REGEXP_CONTAINS, with
  `.`→`\.` and `*`→`.*`; BigQuery LIKE has no ESCAPE clause), keeps a
  single representative shard per source (GA shards share one schema, so every
  daily shard is not pulled into the metadata), and relabels the columns back to
  the wildcard identity (`events_*`) so lineage is stable across days instead of
  pointing at a dated shard. Non-wildcard sources keep exact-match behavior.
  (Requires the sharded dataset to be within the configured metadata-collection
  scope, i.e. covered by `source_project_filters` and not excluded, so the shard
  columns are present in `current_target_columns`.) The JS engine already resolves
  a wildcard source against relabeled metadata; no bundle change.

- Handled `GROUP BY ALL`. The `ALL` keyword was parsed as a grouping expression
  and mis-resolved to a column (`PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` for "ALL"). The
  GroupByParser now recognises the `GROUP BY ALL` form and emits no grouping
  column reference (grouping-key lineage is carried by the SELECT items).

- Supported wildcard tables and pseudo-columns. `FROM \`project.dataset.events_*\``
  now resolves its columns from the collected shard-table schemas (matching the
  `events_*` pattern against the metadata), so downstream columns resolve instead
  of reporting `PHYSICAL_METADATA_NOT_FOUND`. The pseudo-columns `_TABLE_SUFFIX`,
  `_TABLE_DATE`, `_PARTITIONTIME`, `_PARTITIONDATE`, and `_FILE_NAME` are now
  recognised and resolved with no dependency instead of raising
  `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`.

- Resolved `UNNEST` value lineage. A reference to the whole UNNEST element
  (`UNNEST(item_id) AS item_id`, or `UNNEST(t.items) AS x`) now traces back to the
  underlying array column/field instead of stopping at `UNNEST_DEFERRED`; the
  `WITH OFFSET` position column is treated as a no-lineage integer. This completes
  the earlier UNNEST-value change that only removed the hard error.

- Broadened common BigQuery syntax coverage after a parser sweep. Each of these
  previously aborted parsing (PARTIAL_FAILURE), mis-read a keyword as a column
  (spurious PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND), or raised a hard ERROR:
  - Typed literals `DATE '...'`, `TIMESTAMP '...'`, `DATETIME '...'`,
    `TIME '...'`, `NUMERIC '...'`, `BIGNUMERIC '...'`, `BYTES '...'`,
    `JSON '...'` (a type keyword followed by a string literal; `DATE(...)` etc.
    still parse as function calls).
  - `INTERVAL n UNIT` / `INTERVAL expr UNIT [TO UNIT]` (a column-valued interval
    keeps its dependency).
  - Raw and bytes string prefixes in the lexer: `r'...'`, `b'...'`, and the
    `rb`/`br` combinations, for both quote styles.
  - Scientific-notation numeric literals (`1.5e3`, `2E-4`) in the lexer.
  - `x [NOT] IN UNNEST(array_expr)`.
  - `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT` set operators with `DISTINCT`/`ALL`, disambiguated
    from the `SELECT * EXCEPT(col)` column-exclusion syntax.
  - `UNNEST(...) [AS v] WITH OFFSET [AS off]` in the FROM clause.
  - The named `WINDOW` clause (`... WINDOW w AS (...)`).
  - `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (n PERCENT)`.
  - A reference to an `UNNEST` value/offset alias (e.g. `SELECT v FROM t,
    UNNEST(arr) AS v`) now resolves to that source instead of raising a hard
    `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND`; element-to-array lineage for a bare `UNNEST`
    value remains deferred (reported as a LINEAGE warning, not an error).
  Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_038.js`. Known remaining niche gaps (left as-is):
  `EXTRACT(WEEK(<WEEKDAY>) FROM ...)` and query parameters `@param` (the latter
  cannot appear in a view definition).

- Added `LIKE` / `NOT LIKE` operator support to the ExpressionParser. The parser
  had no rule for `LIKE`, so any predicate using it (e.g. `col_b LIKE '110%'`)
  raised `ExpressionParser: unexpected token "LIKE"`, which aborted source
  discovery (`Source discovery did not complete ...` / PARTIAL_FAILURE) in
  WHERE/JOIN clauses, and in a SELECT item mis-read `LIKE` as a column name
  (`PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` for "LIKE"). `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` now parse as
  comparison expressions (keeping the operand column dependencies), the
  quantified `LIKE ANY|SOME|ALL (...)` form parses as an IN-style pattern list,
  and `LIKE` is reserved so it is never treated as an identifier. Covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_037.js`.

- Fixed unqualified column resolution across a JOIN of derived sources. In a
  scope with more than one source (e.g. `FROM cte c LEFT JOIN (subquery) f`), an
  unqualified column that exists only in a derived source (CTE/subquery) was left
  UNRESOLVED_COLUMN with zero candidates by the ColumnResolver — which has no
  physical schema and cannot see columns a derived source exposes through a `*`
  cascade — so it never reached disambiguation. Downstream, a `SELECT * ... UNION
  ALL ...` propagated this as a `PARTIALLY_RESOLVED` column at the
  `SET_OPERATION_QUERY` scope (the reported symptom). `PhysicalColumnResolver`
  now performs a late disambiguation using the derived column lists it can
  compute: `#resolveAmbiguousReference` and a new scope-source recovery both go
  through `#disambiguateAcrossSources`, which checks physical and derived
  (CTE/subquery) sources alike. If exactly one source in the reference's scope
  exposes the column it resolves there; if more than one it stays ambiguous
  (never silently guessed); if none it is left unresolved (correlated/outer
  references are not disturbed). Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_036.js`.

- Added the `SOURCE_METADATA_NOT_COLLECTED` diagnostic (WARNING). A `SELECT *`
  over a physical table whose column metadata was not in the collected set
  expanded to zero columns silently (`WILDCARD_NOT_EXPANDED`); in a UNION this
  surfaced far downstream as an unexplained `UNRESOLVED` column at the
  `SET_OPERATION_QUERY` scope, with no indication of which table was missing.
  `PhysicalColumnResolver` now records any physical-table wildcard source that
  has no collected columns (top-level and through recursive derived expansion)
  and emits one WARNING per such table, naming it and pointing at widening the
  metadata collection filters. Explicit column references already warned via
  `PHYSICAL_METADATA_NOT_FOUND`; this covers the previously-silent `*` case.
  Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_035.js`.

- Fixed `SELECT * EXCEPT(...)` being lost through multi-level wildcard cascades.
  A single `SELECT *` over an `EXCEPT` CTE dropped the column correctly, but when
  `*` cascaded two or more levels (e.g. `x_all AS (SELECT * EXCEPT(col_a) ...)`
  then `x_some AS (SELECT * FROM x_all)` then `SELECT * FROM x_some`), the
  recursive expansion in `PhysicalColumnResolver#expandDerivedScopeColumns`
  re-expanded the underlying table without re-applying the upstream `EXCEPT`, so
  the excluded column silently reappeared — producing wrong column sets (and, in
  a UNION/set-operation with mismatched branches, spurious resolution failures).
  Each scope's `wildcard_exclusions` are now applied during recursive derived
  expansion, so multi-level `EXCEPT`s compose correctly. Covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_034.js`.

- Added `#` single-line comment support to the lexer. BigQuery treats both `--`
  and `#` as single-line comments, but the lexer only recognized `--` and
  `/* ... */`, so a `#` comment (e.g. between CTEs) corrupted parsing and caused
  spurious `PHYSICAL_METADATA_NOT_FOUND` / partial-resolution results. `#` is now
  tokenized as a COMMENT to end-of-line, identically to `--`. Covered by
  `test/test_v1_5_0_034.js`.

- Enriched `LINEAGE_PARTIALLY_RESOLVED` / `LINEAGE_UNRESOLVED` diagnostics so
  they point at the SQL and name what failed, even for wildcard-expanded output
  columns. Wildcard-expanded outputs (`output_column_id = "WILDCARD_<n>"`) are
  synthetic and have no source token range, so previously these diagnostics had
  `line_number` / `column_number` / `sql_fragment` = null and no dependency
  breakdown — making a partial resolution over a `SELECT *` / set operation
  impossible to locate. `LineageResolver#addDiagnostics` now (1) resolves an SQL
  location by falling back to the offending branch/derived scope's token range
  (`via_derived_scope_id` etc.), and finally the output scope's range, recording
  which was used in `location_basis`
  (`OUTPUT_COLUMN` / `UNRESOLVED_BRANCH_SCOPE` / `OUTPUT_SCOPE` / `UNLOCATED`);
  and (2) attaches `unresolved_dependencies[]` (with `dependency_status`,
  `source_reference_name`, `branch_scope_id`, `branch_scope_type`,
  `via_derived_output_column_name`), `unresolved_dependency_count`, `scope_type`,
  and `expression_text`, and lists the unresolved columns in the message. These
  flow into the exported diagnostic's `line_number` / `sql_fragment` /
  `sql_context` columns and into `diagnostic_json`, so the persisted
  `lineage_diagnostic` table gains the detail with no repository DDL change.
  Covered by `test/test_v1_5_0_033.js`.

- Note (not yet fixed): in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`, the
  `staged_direct_dependency` edges only ever show `resolution_status = 'RESOLVED'`
  for wildcard-expanded columns. The table is built from `lineage_paths` (which
  contains resolved physical edges only, so a non-resolving UNION branch produces
  no row), and its `resolution_status` join casts `output_column_id` to `INT64`
  while wildcard IDs are the string `WILDCARD_<n>` (→ NULL → the join misses →
  `COALESCE(..., 'RESOLVED')`). Use `lineage_diagnostic.diagnostic_json`
  (`unresolved_dependencies`) for the unresolved detail; a follow-up can fix the
  join and add a non-physical-edge representation.

- Widened physical-source metadata collection in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` from a single target dataset to every
  same-region dataset across configured source projects, fixing
  `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` for Views whose base tables live in other
  datasets or projects. Added `source_project_ids ARRAY<STRING>`; datasets are
  enumerated from each project's `region-<job_region>` SCHEMATA into a
  `source_datasets` temp table, and `current_target_columns`,
  `current_target_column_field_paths`, and `current_target_tables` are built by
  unioning `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` / `COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS` / `TABLES` across
  those datasets. Project identifiers are validated and the union SQL is
  assembled with FORMAT. Requires metadata-read on every listed project and all
  source datasets in job_region; unqualified source references that exist in
  multiple scanned datasets can become `PHYSICAL_COLUMN_AMBIGUOUS`.
  (`06_analyze_changed_objects.sql` and `07_run_single_view_analysis.sql` use
  the same single-dataset collection and are the next to update.)

- Fixed `Script variable exported_json exceeded the size limit of 1048576 bytes`
  in the STEP 3 analysis loop. The full UDF result JSON is now materialized into
  a `udf_result` temp-table cell (which has no 1 MiB cap) instead of a STRING
  script variable, and the staged diagnostics/direct-dependency queries, the
  non-publishable branch, and the non-completed result rows read the arrays and
  scalars from that cell. Only small extracted scalars
  (`udf_analysis_status`, `udf_analysis_message`) are kept in variables, so
  Views whose lineage JSON exceeds 1 MiB no longer abort the pipeline.

- Implemented `CAST(expr AS type)` and `SAFE_CAST(expr AS type)` in the
  ExpressionParser. Previously the `expr AS type` form was not parsed, so these
  functions only survived inside a top-level SELECT item (via the
  raw-expression fallback) and failed elsewhere with
  `ExpressionParser: expected ")", but found "AS".` — breaking any View that
  used CAST/SAFE_CAST in WHERE, JOIN ON, GROUP BY, HAVING, or ORDER BY. The
  value expression now drives lineage and the target type (including
  parameterized precision like `NUMERIC(10, 2)`, angle-bracket parameters like
  `ARRAY<INT64>` / `STRUCT<a INT64, b STRING>`, and a trailing `FORMAT` clause)
  is consumed without producing spurious physical-column references.
- Fixed a related paren-counting defect in the window sub-expression parser
  (`#parseWindowSubExpression`): the `)` that closes an inner function call
  (e.g. `SAFE_CAST(...)`) was mistaken for the window-clause terminator, so any
  function call inside a window `PARTITION BY` / `ORDER BY` truncated the
  sub-expression. This surfaced as a QUALIFY failure
  (`unexpected token ")"`); it now parses correctly.
- Added `test/test_v1_5_0_032.js` covering CAST/SAFE_CAST across SELECT, WHERE,
  JOIN ON, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, and QUALIFY windows, and wired it into
  `test:release`. The 48-case Golden regression and all existing tests still
  pass; the regenerated bundle SHA-256 is recorded in `release_manifest.json`.

- Made repository table names configurable from the declaration block using a
  prefix, a per-table infix, a canonical base name, and a suffix, so
  environments with different naming rules no longer require edits to the body
  of the scripts.
- Added `table_name_prefix`/`table_name_suffix` and seven derived table-name
  variables (with name-format ASSERTs) to `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql`
  and `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql`. Physical names are assembled as
  `prefix + marker + canonical + suffix` (for example prefix `ope_`, marker
  `m_`, suffix `_tky` gives `ope_m_lineage_config_tky`).
- Wrote the master/transaction marker directly as an inline `'m_'` / `'t_'`
  literal in each table's SET line, since the marker rarely changes, while the
  environment-specific prefix and suffix stay as variables (default empty).
  The marker split is `m_` for the configuration and ledger tables (`config`,
  `execution_account_config`, `definition_registry`, `job_registry`) and `t_`
  for the derived analysis outputs (`direct_dependency`, `impact`,
  `diagnostic`); edit a single SET line to reclassify a table.
- Extended `render_dynamic_sql()` with a `repo_tables STRUCT` argument and
  seven fully qualified `__T_*__` placeholders (`__T_CONFIG__`,
  `__T_EXEC_ACCOUNT__`, `__T_DEF_REGISTRY__`, `__T_DIRECT_DEP__`,
  `__T_IMPACT__`, `__T_DIAGNOSTIC__`, `__T_JOB_REGISTRY__`).
- Converted every remaining static repository-table reference in
  `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` to the template -> render -> unresolved
  placeholder ASSERT -> `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` pattern with named `USING`
  parameters, including the STEP 3 changed-object loop (materialized into a
  temporary table so the `FOR ... IN` query stays static), the COMPLETED and
  non-publishable branches, the EXCEPTION replace/restore handler (with
  captured `@@error.*` values), the recursive impact rebuild, and the run and
  pipeline summaries. Repository DDL in `01_setup_lineage_environment.sql` now
  injects the configured names into its `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FORMAT` statements.
- Fixed a pre-existing error surfaced on first execution: `ASSERT ... AS
  FORMAT(...)` is invalid because the assertion message must be a string
  literal (BigQuery: "Expected string literal but got keyword Format"). The two
  formatted assertions in the STEP 3 analysis loop (source-discovery status and
  the 900,000-byte scoped-metadata guard) now use `IF ... THEN RAISE USING
  MESSAGE = FORMAT(...); END IF;`, which is caught by the same per-object
  EXCEPTION handler. The identical construct still exists in
  `06_analyze_changed_objects.sql` (lines 302, 395) and
  `07_run_single_view_analysis.sql` (line 292) and will be fixed with the
  Phase 2 changes.
- Scope note: `04_validate_lineage_environment.sql`,
  `05_repository_integration_test.sql`, and
  `06_analyze_changed_objects.sql` still use the canonical names and are the
  next phase of this change.

# v1.5.0-031

  `discoverPhysicalSourcesForBigQuery` bundle API.
- Retained PhysicalColumnResolver-compatible matching for fully qualified,
  dataset-qualified, and unqualified source names.

- Preserved support for conditionless correlated `LEFT JOIN UNNEST` and `ON TRUE`.
- Added the full UDF result JSON to the final debug result set when analysis is not publishable.

### Tests

- Added `test_v1_5_0_016.js` covering `CONTACTS.CONTACT_VALUE` resolution for both JOIN forms.
- Passed the 46-case Golden regression suite and bundle verification.

## 1.5.0-015 - 2026-07-22

- Preserve the ON/USING requirement for ordinary LEFT JOIN sources.
- Confirm explicit `ON TRUE` support for correlated LEFT JOIN UNNEST.
- Add parser regression test and sample View `v_customer_primary_contact_on_true`.


## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Moved per-object analysis variables into an outer `BEGIN` block.
- Wrapped the replace-and-restore operation in an inner `BEGIN ... EXCEPTION` block.
- Fixed `Unrecognized name: replacement_started` caused by BigQuery exception-handler variable scope.


### Changed

- Centralized every dynamic identifier substitution in the temporary SQL function `render_dynamic_sql()`.
- Removed intermediate identifier variables including `repository_identifier`, `target_identifier`, `target_project_identifier`, and `udf_identifier`.
- Standardized all dynamic SQL blocks to: template, render, unresolved-placeholder assertion, and execution.
- Continued to pass runtime values through `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ... USING`.


### Fixed

- Fully qualified all three daily-pipeline `MERGE` targets with the `__REPOSITORY__` placeholder.
- Added `repository_identifier = repository_project_id || '.' || repository_dataset`.
- Added unresolved-placeholder assertions before repository `MERGE` execution.


### Changed

- Unified dynamic identifier construction in `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` using named placeholders and `REPLACE()`.
- Added `__TARGET__`, `__TARGET_PROJECT__`, `__JOB_REGION__`, and `__UDF__` placeholders.
- Retained `USING` parameters for runtime values such as lookback days and UDF arguments.
- Added unresolved-placeholder assertions before every dynamic SQL execution.


### Changed

- `03_run_daily_lineage_pipeline.sql` now declares repository project, repository dataset, target project, target dataset, job region, UDF location, parser strict mode, and maximum impact rank at the beginning of the script.
- The daily pipeline no longer reads scalar environment settings from `lineage_config`.
- Repository tables use `@@dataset_project_id` and `@@dataset_id`; dynamic identifiers for metadata and UDF calls use `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`.
- Scheduled Query and DAG service-account arrays remain managed in `lineage_execution_account_config`.


### Fixed

- Removed the unsupported `NOT NULL` constraint from the `ARRAY<STRING>` service account column. Non-empty arrays remain enforced by setup assertions and validation checks.

### Fixed

- Changed dynamic configuration reads from `SELECT AS STRUCT` to a single explicit `STRUCT(...)` column so `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ... INTO config` receives exactly one column.

- JavaScript source and regression fixtures
- Actual execution evidence
- Looker Studio operational dashboard
