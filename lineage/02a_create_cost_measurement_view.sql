-- 02a_create_cost_measurement_view_fixed.sql
-- Long-form sample View for lineage cost and performance measurement
-- ============================================================================
-- Prerequisite:
--   Run sql/sample/02_setup_sample_environment.sql first.
--
-- Design:
--   Keep the View definition near 500 lines while keeping compact UDF output
--   below the BigQuery scripting variable limit. The SQL exercises CTEs,
--   joins, nested fields, CASE, aggregate functions, ARRAY<STRUCT>,
--   window functions, QUALIFY, PIVOT, UNION ALL, and
--   customer-level pre-aggregation joined into the final query.
